The focal project will be to sample arthropods from high-elevation sites in the Ouachita Mountains of Arkansas and Oklahoma, employ high-throughput DNA barcoding methods to uncover biodiversity patterns, and relate those patterns to environmental variables and ecosystem function.  Prospective applicants should have research interests in entomology, ecology, and evolutionary biology, and should have strong field, lab, and analytical skills.  Applicants with previous experience using molecular techniques (e.g., PCR, NGS library preparation, metabarcoding, etc.) and bioinformatics are preferred.  Experience with GIS and/or R is also desirable. \n Financial support will be provided through a combination of teaching and research assistantships.  Assistantships come with a full tuition (not fees) waiver and 67% of the student health insurance paid for by the university.  The selected applicant would need to be admitted to a Ph.D. program at the University of Arkansas for the Spring 2026 semester, which begins January 12, 2026.  Students admitted to a Ph.D. program may also be eligible for a U of A Doctoral Fellowship that adds to their assistantship stipend for 4 years.  More information about these fellowships can be found at: https://graduate-students.uark.edu/cost-and-funding/index.php.  Note that applications for these fellowships require the GRE General Test even if it is not required for admission to a graduate program.  Applicants who would be competitive for a doctoral fellowship will be viewed favorably.  Continued support will be contingent on satisfactory performance and progress. \n Research in the Forest Ecology & Health Lab uses field experiments and naturally occurring environmental gradients to examine how biogeochemistry and nutrients impact community structure and trophic interactions among soil arthropods and ant species primarily in forest ecosystems.  This project is in collaboration with Dr. Donald Shepard in the University of Arkansas, Department of Biological Sciences, and Dr. Ashley Dowling in the University of Arkansas, Department of Entomology and Plant Pathology.  More information about their research and labs can be found at: https://shepardlab.wixsite.com/home and https://adowling.hosted.uark.edu/index.html.  Information about the Ph.D. in Entomology program and its requirements is provided here: https://enpl.uark.edu/programs/phd-program.php. Depending on their interests and goals, the selected applicant may have the option to apply through the Ph.D. in Biology program: https://biology.uark.edu/academics/graduate/index.php. \n To apply, send an email to Dr. Natalie Clay (nclay@uark.edu) that includes as attachments: 1) a cover letter expressing your interest and highlighting your qualifications for the position as well as your future career goals, 2) your curriculum vitae, 3) an unofficial copy of your college transcripts, and 4) names and contact information for three professional references.  To receive full consideration, submit your application by August 1, 2025; however, applications will be considered until the position is filled.  Note: the selected applicant will still need to apply to and be accepted into a Ph.D. program at the University of Arkansas.  The application deadline for Spring 2026 admission is September 1 for Entomology and October 1 for Biology.  Please email Dr. Clay (nclay@uark.edu) with any questions or concerns about the project/position.  \n Natalie A.

MS Concentrations include Conservation Biology, Environmental Education, Advocacy for Social Justice and Sustainability, and several others. In Conservation Biology, students focus on gaining quantitative (GIS and statistics), writing, and ecological field skills. Students also gain experience with community engagement, social justice, and applied research and service.\n\nStudents often work with Antioch faculty in our existing research programs. Specifically in our Conservation Biology concentration, we have expertise in vertebrate ecology (e.g., birds, snakes), invertebrate ecology (e.g., estuarine invertebrates, insects), tropical ecology, forest ecology, alpine ecology, marine ecology, and coastal restoration. In some cases, faculty may have extramural funding to support students in seasonal field and lab positions, including research in New England and in the Caribbean. Students who are eligible for US federal work-study can work part time in various on-campus work-study positions, including Graduate Teaching and Research Assistantships and various positions in our numerous campus centers (e.g., Institute for International Conservation, Spatial Analysis Lab). However, you need to be accepted and taking classes as a graduate student to be eligible for these work-study positions. Students at Antioch generally pay for at least part of their own tuition, but we offer numerous university-wide grants and scholarships, which can help defray tuition costs, and which are detailed here: https://www.antioch.edu/admission-aid/financial-aid/scholarships-and-grants/ . We also work with students to help them apply for external scholarships, fellowships, and research-focused grants.\n\nStudents can earn their graduate degree with either face-to-face classes at the Antioch University New England campus in Keene, NH, USA, or fully online classes (that can be taken from anywhere) which are offered each semester, or with a mixture of the two. Ecological field trip classes (intensive 1-2 week trips to destinations abroad and in-country) are also available for all students. All classes are just 1-2 days a week, making this a viable program for environmental professionals working part or full-time. Our programs are student-centered, flexible, and tailored to meet your individual needs, learning style, and location.\n\nJoin our tight-knit community as we strive to advance social and environmental justice, conserve biodiversity, and mitigate climate change as a department and as a university! For more information about our programs, visit our webpages (https://www.antioch.edu/academics/program-finder?_sft_focus=environmental-studies-sustainability ,  https://www.antioch.edu/academics/environmental-studies-sustainability/environmental-studies-ms/conservation-biology-es-ms/ ) or contact Melissa Baptiste, Admissions Counselor, at mbaptiste (at) antioch.edu. \nContact\nMelissa Baptiste\nmbaptiste@antioch.edu (preferred contact method)",

Despite this, the status of most small mammal species in Oregon is uncertain. In Oregon’s State Wildlife Action Plan, several are identified as Species of Greatest Conservation Need (e.g., Western gray squirrel, red tree vole) while many others are recognized as Species of Greatest Information Need (e.g., Preble’s shrew). The most recent data we have on a state-wide scale to inform the conservation and management of small mammals in Oregon are records reported within “Land Mammals of Oregon” (Verts & Carraway, 1998). The long-term goal of this project is to update estimates of i) distribution, ii) abundance, iii) and habitat associations for a range small mammals statewide. A critical step towards this goal is developing capacity for large-scale sampling of small mammals, which requires a suite of non-invasive survey tools applicable to three key groups: i) arboreal species, e.g., Western grey squirrels, red tree voles, ii) terrestrial species e.g., Preble’s shrew, and iii) fossorial species e.g., pocket gophers. Optimal multi-method protocols will be developed through field and lab tests paired with simulations. Depending on students’ interests, there will be scope to develop research focused on any or all the key species and groups. This PhD will facilitate future statewide sampling of small mammals to inform conservation action for a range of species. \n This PhD program will involve extensive field work in western Oregon (planning, establishing, and running field trials using a combination of invasive and non-invasive methods including capturing small mammals) as well as quantitative model development. We will develop and test a suite of non-invasive sampling methods applicable to a range of small mammals and use simulations to produce optimal multi-method sampling protocols for arboreal, terrestrial, and fossorial mammals in Oregon. The student will join a growing and supportive lab group and work closely with project partners including state agency collaborators at Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, Oregon Biodiversity Information Center, and NCASI. The student will be expected to integrate as an active collaborator and facilitate project management. They will co-develop and implement a project-related dissertation under the mentorship of their advisor, Dr. Joshua P. Twining.  \n \n\n \nStart date: January 5th, 2026\n \n \n\nFunding: Fully funded, including 12 months of salary (~$30-33k) and covering the costs of tuition, fees, and benefits each year. The student will be supported through a combination of graduate research assistantships and employment as a graduate teaching assistant. \n Minimum requirements:  \n•      Applicants must meet the OSU Graduate School minimum requirements for admission (found at: https://gradschool.oregonstate.edu/admissions/academic-requirements).  \n•      BS in Ecology or an associated field by the expected start date. E.g., wildlife, conservation, biology, or allied fields. \n•      Strong quantitative base (e.g., statistical training, competency in R)  \n•      Aptitude and enthusiasm for fieldwork under variety of conditions \n•      Strong written and oral communication skills across different types of audiences.  \n•      Resilience and adaptability \n•      Ability to work both independently and collaboratively as part of a team \n \n\nPreferred skills and qualifications: \n•      MS in Ecology or an associated field by the expected start date. E.g., wildlife, conservation, biology, or allied fields  \n•      Demonstration of an ability to take projects from planning and implementation through to completion with written products (e.g., peer reviewed publications). \n•      Trapping and handling mammals \n•      Familiarity with genetic methods (e.g., microsatellite analyses, sanger sequencing) \n•      Hierarchical modelling (e.g., occupancy modelling, spatial-recapture recapture) \n•      Experience with Bayesian inference and familiarity with relevant software \n To apply: Please submit the following via email as a single PDF document: \n\n1.      Cover letter, less than 2-pages single-spaced (size 12 font) describing how you meet the minimum and preferred requirements for this role, your research interests and experiences, what you ultimately hope to do achieve within and after the PhD.  \n\n2.      A current resume or curriculum vitae \n\n3.      Transcripts (unofficial copy is okay for review, but official needed if selected) \n\n4.      The names and contact information of three academic or professional references  \n Email your application packet to Dr. Joshua P.

Our research focuses on quantifying vegetation dynamics over space and time and identifying how the relative importance of ecological processes structuring plant communities changes with spatial and temporal scale. In addition, a key goal of our research is to understand how pattern and process in plant communities will be altered in the face of global environmental change. An important motivation for our work is to address ecological questions at large spatial scales to inform landscape conservation. We collect field data, use existing large observational data sets, and implement simulation modeling to address these goals in temperate shrublands, wetlands, woodlands, and forests. Additional information about the lab can be found at http://www.kylepalmquist.org/.\n RESEARCH FOCUS: The successful candidate will explore the interacting effects of sea-level rise and increased storm surge on coastal vegetation and the effects of prescribed fire on pine-dominated vegetation on Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island (MCRDPI), a sea-island in South Carolina. Coastal vegetation provides important ecosystem services, including storm protection, erosion control, and habitat for wildlife. These complex, highly zoned plant communities are structured by multiple environmental factors including salinity, elevation, soil texture, soil moisture, exposure, and light availability. Sea-level rise and intensification of the hydrologic cycle (i.e. more frequent and intense storms) is expected to affect the distribution and composition of coastal vegetation in the future, with important implications. Prescribed fire has been implemented in pine woodlands and forests on the island to enhance their resilience to climate change and to restore their structure from closed forests to open woodlands. The effects of prescribed fire have yet to be assessed. The project will integrate remote sensing, plant community sampling, and modeling to quantify how sea-level rise and associated factors have impacted coastal vegetation up to present and how climate change may influence vegetation in the future. An additional goal is to assess how prescribed fire is influencing pine-dominated vegetation on the island by installing and re-sampling permanent vegetation plots.   \n PREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS: A background, including relevant course work, in botany or plant ecology, and GIS or remote sensing, strong communication skills, and strong quantitative skills. Experience in remote sensing and GIS and knowledge of the southeastern US flora is highly desirable.\n EXPECTATIONS: The successful candidate will be expected to conduct high-quality research, serve as a teaching assistant within the Department of Biological Sciences, present their research to the scientific community at regional and national meetings, and publish in peer-reviewed scientific journals.\n TIMELINE: The position is available starting January 2026 and possibly before.\n FUNDING: Funding will consist of a combination of research and teaching assistantships for two years. A 12-month competitive stipend ($20,000), and full tuition waiver will be provided. The student is responsible for covering University fees.\n HOW TO APPLY: Interested students should apply by submitting the following to Dr. Kyle Palmquist (palmquist@marshall.edu): 1) short statement of research interests and career goals (no longer than 1 page), 2) CV, 3) unofficial transcripts, and 4) contact information for three professional references. Please include: “MS position – coastal vegetation” and your name in the email subject.\n Review of applications will begin immediately and continue until a candidate is selected. I will contact you to discuss your research interests and goals for graduate school if I determine you would be a good fit for the lab. If selected, a full application must be submitted to the Department of Biological Sciences at Marshall University, Huntington, WV. Faculty in the Department of Biological Sciences have expertise in a variety of biological fields, including but not limited to ecology, evolution, herpetology, and physiology. More information about the Department and its programs can be found here: https://www.marshall.edu/biology/. Application requirements for admission to the DBS graduate program can be found here: https://www.marshall.edu/biology/admission/.\n Marshall University is located in Huntington, an affordable college town located on the Ohio River in the beautiful state of West Virginia. The town is small enough to get around on foot and bike, but large enough to support a variety of restaurants and other cultural activities. Huntington and the surrounding area offer ample recreational opportunities (hiking, skiing, rafting), along with proximity to larger cities, including Louisville, KY, Cincinnati, OH, and Columbus, OH. In the Palmquist Lab, we highly value and encourage work-life balance. \n I strongly encourage students from diverse backgrounds and experiences to apply. Feel free to contact me with questions at any time.\n \nContact\nKyle Palmquist\npalmquist@marshall.edu (preferred contact method)",

Quantifying zooplankton diversity and abundance is vital for monitoring ecosystem health, but traditional methods based on microscopy are labor-intensive and often provide limited taxonomic resolution. Metabarcoding offers promise of faster, cheaper, more accurate, and higher-resolution characterization of zooplankton biodiversity. However, these methods can be limited by primer biases, incomplete reference databases, and challenges in accurately reflecting organismal biomass. Shotgun metagenomics - sequencing all DNA present in a sample without the need for targeted amplification - may provide a more comprehensive and unbiased view of community composition. This approach has the potential to offer a more accurate estimate of relative abundance, but its performance and practicality for application on complex real-world tissue mixtures has not yet been validated. Accordingly, both metabarcoding and metagenomic approaches will need careful context-specific evaluation and benchmarking against traditional approaches prior to any large-scale implementation in monitoring programs. This position offers the exciting opportunity to assess the performance of these emerging techniques in a real-world monitoring program and help shape the future of aquatic ecosystem assessment.\n KEY RESPONSIBILITIES:\nThe project will generate side-by-side comparisons of results from metabarcoding, metagenomics, and traditional microscopy on samples collected by the Hudson River Lower Food Web Monitoring Program. The postdoc is expected to lead efforts in the following five areas:\n·      Design and refine experimental and laboratory protocols for DNA extraction and library preparation from bulk tissue and water samples\n·      Analyze high-throughput sequencing data and optimize bioinformatic pipelines for both metabarcoding and metagenomic workflows\n·      Build and curate taxonomic reference databases from public repositories and de novo sequencing\n·      Collaborate with partners and regional stakeholders and co-organize annual workshops to promote knowledge exchange\n·      Prepare peer-reviewed publications and presentations for both scientific and broader audiences\n DESIRED QUALIFICATIONS:\n·      A Ph.D. in molecular ecology, bioinformatics, evolutionary biology, environmental genomics, or a related field\n·      Demonstrated experience with metabarcoding, metagenomics, or other environmental DNA applications\n·      Proficiency in programming and bioinformatics tools for high-throughput sequence analysis\n·      Excellent organizational skills, attention to detail, and ability to work both independently and collaboratively in a team environment.\n·      Strong written and verbal communication skills\n·      Commitment to fostering an inclusive and supportive research environment\n            TERMS OF APPOINTMENT:\nThis is a full-time position starting in late summer 2025 (or as soon as possible thereafter).

Description – We are seeking qualified applicants for a PhD position that will focus on migration ecology
of American woodcock. As a component of their dissertation research, the student will coordinate a
large-scale collaborative research project that seeks to better understand woodcock migration throughout
eastern North America. Our project uses GPS transmitters to collect data on individual woodcock during
both fall and spring migratory periods, as well as during non-migratory periods, and involves working
with a diverse array of project partners that include state and federal agencies, non-governmental
organizations, and other universities. As a member of this collaborative team, the successful applicant
will be responsible for capturing and tagging woodcock prior to migration, retrieving location data and
managing large databases, regularly communicating progress with project partners and other stakeholder
groups, analyzing data, presenting results at meetings and conferences, and publishing research findings.

to GPS location data collected from ~700 marked individuals, which have collected more than 40,000
locations from throughout North America to date. While the specific directions for dissertation research
are open to the student’s interests, we anticipate that topic areas will build on recent and ongoing research
questions in this system (see publications and reports woodcockmigration.org/research). We anticipate a
final dissertation comprised of 4 chapters suitable for submission to peer-reviewed journals, as well as the
opportunity to contribute as a coauthor on other manuscripts completed as part of the research
collaborative.

The student will be a member of the Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Conservation Biology at the

Project Description: Lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) populations have declined across much of their range in North America owing to factors that include overharvest, impoundment of rivers, and habitat loss. Like other sturgeons, the life-history attributes of Lake Sturgeon (e.g., late age at maturity) make them vulnerable to overharvest and slow to recruit to the spawning population. Restoration of Lake Sturgeon populations requires effective management and long-term monitoring. Thus, information about the abundance, reproductive status, and spawning success of Lake Sturgeon provides useful information for species recovery. A cooperative effort between the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MN DNR) and the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and Parks (SD GFP) aims to return Lake Sturgeon to Big Stone Lake in the upper Minnesota River basin. Young Lake Sturgeon have been stocked annually by MN DNR in Big Stone Lake since 2014. Survival of these fish has been good for a number of year-classes, with some (older) fish now exceeding fifty inches. The goals of this project include evaluating the Lake Sturgeon population within the upper Minnesota River basin and assessing fish movements to evaluate the effectiveness of stocking and habitat restoration efforts. By evaluating movement and reproductive status of the Lake Sturgeon population, this study will help identify the importance of restored spawning areas as well as other potential habitats including juvenile/adult rearing habitats.

This project stems from the efforts of an international coalition led by the Environment Agency – Abu Dhabi, the Government of Chad, and nonprofit conservation organization Sahara Conservation to restore a viable population of oryx in their former native range.

Project synopsis: Movement is essential to fitness, as animals must pursue resources and mates, defend territories, and avoid predators and other threats. Animals reintroduced into a novel landscape face particularly extreme movement requirements, including exploring their new environment, rapidly acquiring resources, and identifying valuable foraging patches and breeding sites. These activities carry increased risks and energetic costs that may influence the survival and reproduction of individuals, larger social groups, and entire populations. The successful candidate will use video observations of oryx under human care, a species-specific ethogram, accelerometry and GPS tracking data, and emerging analytical approaches (e.g., hidden Markov and machine learning models) to classify oryx movement behavior. Activity budgets for reintroduced oryx will be used to estimate individual energetic costs over time. Contemporaneous field monitoring data will be used to investigate the potential fitness consequences of behavior regimes over short (e.g., within seasons) and long (e.g., with increasing experience) time periods. These analyses will directly inform the active reintroduction of oryx and other Critically Endangered Sahelo-Saharan antelope at sites across North, West, and Central Africa, and predict how ongoing land cover and projected climate change may affect these species.

JMU Biology Graduate Program: The successful candidate will be based at JMU (Harrisonburg, VA) with a small cohort of Master’s students. During the two-year program, they will embark on a rigorous research training experience through coursework and a mentored thesis project co-advised by Dr. Katherine Mertes (Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute, Washington, DC and Front Royal, VA). In exchange for teaching five lab sections over four semesters, the candidate will receive a stipend and tuition waiver throughout their tenure.

Graduate Assistantship in Amphibian Ecology and Conservation,University of Wyoming (State),https://jobs.rwfm.tamu.edu/view-job/?id=103198,03/07/2025,01/27/2025,between 8/17/2025 and 8/18/2025,30 - 40,Commensurate / Negotiable,Bachelors,at least 2 years,"Laramie, Wyoming",Graduate Opportunities,"­­Dr. Gabriel Barrile at the University of Wyoming is recruiting a graduate student interested in amphibian ecology and conservation.

Overview of the project: We are seeking an MSc student to investigate the reproductive ecology of amphibians. Specifically, this project will evaluate the characteristics of natural and anthropogenic waterbodies that support successful amphibian reproduction in Thunder Basin National Grassland (TBNG), which is inhabited by six of the eleven amphibian species native to Wyoming, four of which are Species of Greatest Conservation Need. TBNG is an arid rangeland with extensive ranching, where stock ponds constitute a dominant form of aquatic habitat. It is suspected that stock ponds and other anthropogenic water features (e.g., irrigation ditches, catch ponds above roads) serve as important breeding habitat for local amphibians. Yet, the characteristics of these artificial habitats (e.g., size, shape, salinity) that confer species-specific breeding success are unknown. This project will determine species-specific habitat requirements and assess the relative importance of artificial versus natural waterbodies in supporting amphibian reproduction.

This project is funded largely by the Wyoming Game and Fish Department (WGFD). The graduate student will work closely with WGFD personnel (fisheries biologists and the herpetological coordinator) to achieve project objectives, including and especially those that directly inform the management of amphibians and their habitat. Results from this study will provide information on species distribution, local abundance, and breeding habitat preferences for half of the amphibian species in the state of Wyoming. Through conducting this project, the graduate student will develop valuable skills in geographic information systems, spatial analysis, computer programming, data science, field ecology, amphibian conservation, and collaborative research. Previous experience with computer programming (e.g., Program R, Python) and conducting field work with amphibians is preferred but not required.

The position will begin in Fall 2025. The student will be given 2 years of funding (stipend + tuition), with the remaining semesters funded by internal or external fellowships and Teaching Assistantships. The candidate is expected to collaborate extensively with other members of the Barrile Lab. The lab sits within the Department of Zoology & Physiology and School of Computing at the University of Wyoming. Our goal is to develop a supportive and respectful community that fosters curiosity and exploration, produces high-quality original science, and launches productive and passionate independent scientists. We expect members of the lab to share our values for enthusiasm, communication, and collective excellence. 

Qualifications: Candidates must hold a Bachelor’s degree in wildlife, biology, ecology, computing, statistics, or a related field. The successful candidate for this position will have a strong working knowledge of wildlife ecology, excellent verbal and written communication skills, and analytical expertise including but not limited to spatial analyses and data management. Prior field experience and animal handling are strongly desired. Skills relevant to the project’s components will be viewed favorably (e.g., strong scientific writing, experience with statistical analyses). 

Application Instructions: To apply, please send the following to Gabe Barrile (gbarrile@uwyo.edu) in a single PDF: (1) a cover letter (1–2 pages) highlighting your qualifications, research motivations, your short and long-term career goals, and why you are interested in the project; (2) a curriculum vitae / resume that outlines your academic and professional experience; (3) a writing sample, which could be a technical report, academic paper, or class research project; (4) copies of unofficial transcripts or a list of classes taken, as well as your undergraduate GPA (please do not send GRE scores); and (5) names and email addresses of 3 references.

In our research on the spongy moth, we have used molecular markers and morphological studies to confirm, for the first time, the invasion of the European spongy moth in China. We also established a tracing system for spongy moths, advancing international pest tracking and tracing technologies. In the field of forestry invasive species, we identified the pine wood nematode’s northward spread across the Yangtze River, studied the distribution and spread of multiple invasive species, developed molecular diagnostic tools, proposed monitoring, and control strategies for European woodwasp, and effectively reduced infestation rates. In pest risk analysis, we were the first in China to build a quantitative pest risk analysis system supported by @risk software. We utilized climate models to predict potential suitable habitats for invasive species, thereby strengthening biosecurity management.

This project will characterize genetic diversity and population structure using whole genome sequencing approaches on representative samples of wild lumpfish from across the GoM and surrounding regions. Environmental variables such as temperature will be correlated with genetic variation, and common-garden experiments may be conducted to test for adaptive variation. This research will help ensure that lumpfish broodstock used in selective breeding efforts capture natural levels of diversity, and this work may identify key adaptive traits, such as thermal tolerance, which would inform selective breeding decisions as well as understanding the natural history of lumpfish and adaptation in marine systems.

The first is on the effect of climate change and wind turbine construction on the Atlantic surfclam and ocean quahog resource using a coupled fishery-population dynamics model (SEFES) that includes a future climate projection capability. Development of wind energy on the continental shelf may influence fisheries by limiting access, increasing vessel steaming costs, and limiting stock surveys. Warming of the northwest Atlantic is rapidly shifting the range of the surfclam resource and impinging the species upon territory occupied by ocean quahogs, one of the oldest marine species. The project will address management issues arising from the influence of global warming and competitive uses of the continental shelf with respect to maintaining a sustainable clam resource and fishery. The successful candidate will develop a masters or dissertation project in connection with research supported by the NSF I/UCRC science center SCEMFIS and provide the opportunity for the candidate to work directly with the fishing industry and the management community. The research is supported by SCEMFIS (NSF Science Center for Marine Fisheries) and private enterprise.

This research will follow a previous graduate student project that identified rock talus as a potentially important hibernacula resource for bats, whose populations in Maine and throughout eastern North America have declined precipitously following the introduction of the fungal pathogen responsible for White Nose Syndrome. The Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife (MDIFW) is interested in better understanding the distribution of bat hibernacula in Maine to inform state policy and conservation of bat populations.  

The successful candidate will work closely with MDIFW biologists on a collaborative field effort using acoustic detectors to sample for the presence of bats during winter at talus slopes throughout Maine.  The student and MDIFW staff will conduct field sampling, and the student will have primary responsibility for data analysis and management, including curating bat call recordings and using classification software to identify calls to species.  The student will work with existing geospatial layers, or develop new layers using remotely sensed data products, to identify the distribution of talus in Maine. The student will apply modelling techniques that evaluate predictors of bat site occupancy at talus, and will develop predictive maps of hibernacula distributions. In consultation with agency collaborators and their graduate committee, the student will also have the opportunity to explore additional questions related to bat ecology during winter as they develop their dissertation chapters.

The student will be a member of the Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Conservation Biology at the University of Maine, with options for pursing a PhD in Wildlife Ecology or Ecology and Environmental Sciences, depending on the student’s interests and background.  They will be advised by Dr. Erik Blomberg, and will also work closely with Cory Stearns, Small Mammal Biologist for MDIFW.

Our recently established research group seeks individuals who are creative, curious about the natural world, and seek to challenge themselves with interesting problems. In our lab, we ask fundamental questions about the role of abiotic and biotic factors on the evolution and maintenance of chemical diversity, communication, and tri-trophic interactions in forest ecosystems. We are especially interested in developing and testing hypotheses relating to how natural enemies shape the ecology and evolution of woodboring insects. Ultimately, we seek to contribute to our understanding of biotic interactions, as well as use our knowledge of behavior and chemistry to optimize biological control of pests and conservation of forest ecosystems.
 PhD project: The emerald ash borer (Coleoptera: Buprestidae: Agrilus planipennis; EAB) is one of the most destructive forest pests in North America. Since its introduction in the mid-1990s, this beetle has spready rapidly throughout the range of its hosts (Fraxinus spp.), killed hundreds of millions of ash trees, and caused immense damage to forest ecosystems and the nursery/timber industries. A recent arrival to the deep south, it is not well-known how EAB and its associates will perform in subtropical ecosystems. The successful candidate will contribute to answering this question, as well as building fundamental and applied understanding of woodborers and their host trees, by investigating how volatile compounds produced by ash trees (Fraxinus) mediate interactions with the invasive emerald ash borer (Coleoptera: Agrilus planipennis), and its classical biological control agents in the southeastern United States.

Snowshoe hares have been studied for >30 years on-site, and we are launching an assessment of the role of food and cover on hare movements and spatial dynamics in the context of their 10-year population cycles. Using archived as well as new GPS telemetry and accelerometry data, combined with detailed assessment of structural cover and food availability on the landscape, the project will address how hares adjust their movements, habitat selection and spatial dynamics in response to variable environmental risks (exposure to predators) and rewards (nutrition). Our recent work (Boudreau et al. 2019 doi: 10.1007/s00442-019-04500-2; Peers et al. 2020. doi.org/10.1038/s41558-020-00908-4; Shiratsuru et al. 2021 doi.org/10.1002/ecy.3456) suggests that hares live on the fine edge of high risk from predation at Kluane, but this pressure is variable both seasonally and through the hare cycle. Thus, an evolving interest is assessing how hares vary their risk-reward tradeoff both in response to snowcover and through phases of the 10-year population cycle. Because the combined datasets available to the PhD student will span a complete hare population cycle and we are also working on hare predators and vegetation dynamics in the same area, there are excellent opportunities to evaluate complex predator-prey and plant-herbivore interactions, including in the context of climate change. The PhD student will have the opportunity to develop specific research questions within the scope of the larger project and collaborate with other students and researchers working on related questions in the Kluane system.

 Project title: How interactions between predators, parasites, and the environment influence the population dynamics of a cyclical endemic vole.

Summary:  The Twining Applied Quantitative Ecology Lab at Oregon State University is seeking a highly motivated PhD student to conduct applied ecological research focused on understanding the population dynamics of endemic voles (gray-tailed voles, Microtus canicaudus) in the Willamette Valley.

Position description: Population dynamics emerge from the interplay of intrinsic species-specific traits, environmental factors including habitat and climate, and interactions between competition, predation, and disease. Two of the greatest contemporary issues facing ecologists are determining how and to what extent intra- and inter-specific interactions drive system dynamics, and what the impacts of climate change will be on said dynamics. Gray-tailed voles display as-yet uncharacterized and unpredictable cyclical population dynamics. Anecdotally, frequency and amplitude of peaks are increasing, associated with changes in climate and environment. This program will establish and conduct multi-species sampling with the primary goal of producing empirical data to test ecological theory regarding the drivers and mechanisms of interannual population dynamics in gray-tailed voles. The research will include scope to assess the impacts of weather, season, predators (e.g. long-tailed weasels, skunks, coyotes), parasites (Nematoda spp., Ixodes spp.), and pathogens (including pathogens of human concern that the species serves as a reservoir host for i.e. Leptospira spp.) on key demographic parameters (abundance, survival, recruitment).

Department of Fisheries, Wildlife and Conservation Sciences, 
Oregon State University 
 Project Title: Developing non-invasive monitoring methods and models for small mammal populations: small mammal monitoring for tomorrow, today 
 Summary: The Twining Applied Quantitative Ecology Lab at Oregon State University is seeking a highly motivated MS student to conduct quantitative ecology research on small mammals and their predators focused on developing and testing non-invasive sampling methods paired with hierarchical models against spatial-capture-recapture models applied to intensive live-trapping data. 
 Position description: Worldwide, populations of small rodents cause inestimable harm to crop production, human health and socioeconomic stability. The extent of impacts is due to irruptive population dynamics combined with rodents’ roles as key herbivorous pests and abundant host reservoirs for various pathogens of zoonotic concern. The cyclical population dynamics displayed by certain rodents are characterized by extreme, and often unpredictable peaks and busts in population size over multi-year timescales. 
 The Willamette Valley in the Pacific Northwest of the United States is home to an endemic vole which displays unknown, irregular interannual cyclical dynamics, the gray-tailed vole (Microtus canicaudus). At population peaks, such as occurred between 2019 – 2022, losses of up to 90% of yield were reported by crop producers, and prevalence of >30% of leptospirosis was documented, posing major economic and health risks. Critical long-term data on the population dynamics of this cyclical rodent which could be used to inform its management are lacking in part due to difficulties faced sustaining intensive live-trapping efforts over the duration of multi-year interannual cycles. Globally, small mammal population distributions and trends are poorly documented due to the challenges posed by implementing traditional sampling methods on large scales.  
 The key objective of this project will be to establish and demonstrate the efficacy of non-invasive methods for monitoring small mammal populations. The project will be primarily focused on developing and testing non-invasive methods (e.g. arrays of enclosed camera traps and FLIR-mounted drones) ability to estimate population sizes of small mammals and key mammalian predators. Field and associated statistical tools for the non-invasive methods will be developed and tested in silico and empirically against established spatial-capture recapture methods applied to intensive live-trapping data. 
 This masters project will include extensive fieldwork (live trapping,camera trapping, drone surveys) and quantitative modeling (hierarchical models including spatial capture-recapture, Royle Nichols models etc.). The student will join a growing and supportive lab group and have the opportunity to work closely with both key stakeholders including local NGOs and growers and producers in the agricultural community. The student will develop and implement a project-related dissertation under the mentorship of their advisor, Dr. Joshua P. Twining. 
 Start date: September 01, 2025 
 Funding: Two years of support, including 12 months of salary (~$30-33k) and covering the costs of tuition, fees, and benefits. For nine months each year the student would be supported via a graduate research assistant (GRA), and for the remaining months of the year the student would be employed as a graduate teaching assistant (GTA).

Position: Funded 2-year MSc position at Virginia Tech 
Primary supervisor:  Dr. Elizabeth Nyboer, Virginia Tech 
Co-supervisor: Dr. Vivian Nguyen, Carleton University. 

Project description: This project will explore perspectives, experiences, and values of underrepresented and marginalized fisher groups in and around Lake Michigan’s recreational fisheries. It will explore “provisioning fisheries” as a relatively new concept that draws attention to diverse fishers and fisheries that are not well captured in the conventional fisheries research and management frameworks The overarching goal of the project is to characterize and document provisioning fishers and fisheries in and around Lake Michigan to understand the degree to which this segment of the population needs to be prioritized in fisheries management strategies and policies. Specific objectives include to: 
1.      Characterize provisioning fishers in terms of their fishing behavior, needs, motivations, values and socio-demographics. 
2.      Understanding the risks and benefits of engaging in provisioning fisheries. 
3.      Explore experiences, perceptions, expectations, and priorities of provisioning fishers relative to current fisheries management and other relevant policies (e.g., access site development, regulations, communications, consumption advisories). 

Your duties: Your project will be primarily focused on objectives two and three and will involve developing and implementing surveys and interviews/focus groups with groups of underrepresented fisher groups in urban centers on Lake Michigan (Grand Rapids, Chicago, Milwaukee, etc.) and conduct interviews with fisheries managers. You will be involved in recruitment of fishers, conduct all data analysis, preparing manuscripts for publication, and development of knowledge dissemination materials and multi-sectoral workshops. You will be part of a larger research team so excellent coordination and communication skills are a must. Course work will be completed at Virginia Tech in the Department of Fish and Wildlife Conservation in the United States. Please learn more about requirements for graduate students here.  You will be required to complete and successfully defend a research-based MSc Thesis to obtain your degree.

Fargo, North Dakota",Graduate Opportunities,"Position Description:
We are seeking one graduate research assistantship (Ph.D.) to study the mechanisms and consequences of exotic plant invasions in rangelands near Streeter, ND. This research focuses on understanding how exotic grasses, particularly Kentucky bluegrass, invade rangelands, allowing us to develop targeted, effective management of said grasses while also understanding exotic plant invasion as a whole.

Background and Research Details:  
Invasive cool-season grasses degrade and suppress native rangelands across the globe. Kentucky bluegrass is particularly effective at invading rangelands. Management aimed at controlling invasive cool-season grasses use an ineffective and costly one-size-fits-all approach. Understanding what mechanisms allow cool-season grasses to invade and outcompete the surrounding native species will help develop more effective targeted management plans. The research involves a large field experiment examining the mechanisms underlying plant invasion. The experiment consists of 384 experimental plots designed to simulate Kentucky bluegrass invasion in the northern Great Plains so that we may assess its effects on the plant community and underlying soil.  The findings of this study will help understand Kentucky bluegrass invasion in the northern Great Plains and formulate effective management strategies to mitigate the spread of this aggressive invader and simultaneously promote native biodiversity and ecosystem services provided by the region’s rangelands. Moreover, the results will provide a framework by which the mechanisms of other invasive plants can be assessed. 

Minimum Qualifications:
Master’s degree in Plant Ecology, Biology, Range Science, Natural Resource Management, or related field.
Experience with plant identification and sampling.
Data and experimental management and organizational skills/experience.
Willingness or experience working with prescribed fire.
 Ability and willingness to travel and live at the field site (housing provided).
 Ability and willingness to collect data in sometimes adverse conditions.
 Excellent communication skills (verbal and written).
 Valid driver’s license

Preferred Qualifications:
History of working on and managing field experiments with experimental plots.
Experience with plant identification and sampling in the Great Plains.
Analytical experience using R or similar software.
Experience interacting and communicating research to non-scientific audiences
Strong leadership skills including experience supervising and mentoring team members, providing clear instructions, and fostering a positive and collaborative work environment.

To apply: 
Submit one document to Kevin Sedivec (kevin.sedivec@ndsu.edu) that includes: 
 A cover letter discussing your qualifications and future goals
 Curriculum vitae

(OAI) is seeking an applicant to provide assistance in the intake, review, and finalization of fishery disaster declaration requests to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). OAI is a Virginia corporation established in 2003 that provides consulting and technical services to the U.S. government, non-governmental organizations, international organizations, and the private sector. We specialize in scientific program and project management, strategic planning, professional and technical services, and stakeholder engagement, supporting government contracts.

Background

The Magnuson-Stevens Act (MSA) contains provision (Section 312(a)) that allows requests from states, tribes, and other government entities to request the Secretary of Commerce to declare a fishery disaster exists, which makes these entities eligible for congressional funding to help ameliorate the impact of the disaster. Under these provisions, the Department of Commerce, working through NOAA Fisheries, is required to evaluate each fishery disaster and make a determination if a disaster exists. Evaluation is based primarily on data submitted by the requesting state or tribe and a request must meet specific requirements under the MSA to receive a determination that a fishery disaster exists. For example, there must be commercial fishery economic impacts and declines in fishery access or biomass resulting from specific allowable causes due to the fishery disaster event. Each Region of NOAA Fisheries is responsible for the initial evaluation of any fishery disaster requests received from their region and the region also serves as the main point of contact for the requesting entity. All evaluations must follow the new requirements of the amended section 312(a) of the MSA. The lead staff person is required to review the submitted requests for completeness, contact the requestors to resolve any information deficiencies, and once complete information is received, finish the evaluation by the timelines in the MSA. Once the evaluation is complete, the lead staff person is responsible for writing and submitting a formal decision memo for review and clearance at the region and by headquarters staff for a decision by the Secretary of Commerce.

Tasks

Key tasks include the following:

Provide program management support to the Regional Fishery Disaster Assistance Lead (Lead).
Upon receipt of a request from Headquarters staff or the Lead, review the request and contact any requesting entity staff leads identified in the request and provide regional contact information to such staff.
During the time between initial receipt of a request and the final decision and funding of the request, serve as the point of contact and answer any questions from the requestors; if the employee cannot answer a specific question, they will contact the Lead for further assistance.
Review the request and compare the information provided with the required information listed in MSA section 312(a). If any required information is missing or incomplete, the employee shall then notify the requestor’s staff contact about the missing/incomplete information and request the missing/incomplete information be provided or updated, as appropriate. The employee shall inform the Lead via email of any such deficiencies.
Upon receipt of a complete package of information from the requesting entity, evaluate the request based on the methodology contained in the Policy Guidance from the Headquarters office. The employee shall notify the Lead when commencing review of a complete package.
Once the evaluation is complete, draft a decision memo using agreed upon templates for initial review by the Lead, and then make any edits requested by the Lead.
Once a final Memo is drafted, submit the Memo through the appropriate clearance process with Headquarters and the Region; the employee shall be the initial point of contact for any questions from staff during the clearance process, working with the Lead as appropriate.
Start Date: As soon as possible.

(OAI) seeks a full-time Oceanographic Technical Specialist II to support National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA’s), National Ocean Service’s (NOS) Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) in Silver Spring, MD by providing operational engineering and operational oceanography support for the State of Alaska. CO-OPS is the authoritative source for accurate, reliable, and timely tides, water levels, currents, and other coastal oceanographic and meteorological information.

The Alaska Water Level Watch (AWLW) is leveraging collaborative partnerships across governmental and non-governmental entities to make water level data and products more accessible and to expand the capacity for coastal water level observations along Alaska’s coastline. NOS partnered with the AWLW to expand water level monitoring capabilities and test new technologies for operations in Arctic conditions. These activities supplement CO-OPS’ National Water Level Observation Network (NWLON) by providing more localized conditions that feed into the regional network.

Specifically, NOAA CO-OPS will work with the AWLW and the State of Alaska to enhance VDatum coverage in Alaska and supplement the observational capacity of the NWLON. Together, Alaska, AWLW, and NOAA will conduct reconnaissance, installation, operation, maintenance, removal, and data processing of short-term (minimally 30 days) and real-time long-term water level gauges. The results of this work will enhance the coverage and accuracy of VDatum transformations in Alaska while also supplementing CO-OPS’ observational data collected through the NWLON. There are two priorities for this collaborative effort:

● Priority 1 – Using data derived from short-term water level gauging and NOAA-specific tools and applications, generate data products that enable the expansion of VDatum coverage to areas of Alaska not yet included.

● Priority 2 – Fill gaps in the availability of real-time observations by supporting new water level gauging stations that are considered NWLON alternatives and make improvements to the visualization and accessibility of data based on feedback received from users of the AWLW data portal.

We are currently reviewing applications for spring programs, so you may not receive a response to your application initially. However, we review applications as they are received, and early applicants are at an advantage.

Idaho Conservation Corps is seeking young adults ages 19+ to camp, travel, and work together on challenging conservation projects across Idaho.

Applicants must be in good physical condition; capable of working on strenuous, labor-intensive projects as training and work projects often require heavy lifting, constant bending, digging, and hiking long distances to and from the worksite, being on foot for 8-10 hours per day. The applicant must frequently lift and/or move up to 50 pounds (with or without reasonable accommodation).

Crew members camp in tents for 10 weeks, traveling to multiple sites across the mountains and forests of Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. Experienced field staff provide training on projects such as tree planting, fuels reduction, invasive plant removal, and trail construction, using hand and power tools. You join a close-knit team of 4-5 crew members who play a vital role in improving our public lands and the environment.

This is tough work. We work in all weather. Our projects are hands-on, team-based, and physically demanding. Crews camp together the entire session continuously. On weekends, crews usually go into town to resupply on food, get showers and laundry, and explore the area. Occasionally we have backcountry work deep in the forest for two weeks or more. We value community, connection with others, and mutual support. All training is provided. If you haven't had access to the outdoors but are interested in growing your skills, come learn with us.

All crew member positions are AmeriCorps service programs designed to provide hands-on training and experience. Crew alumni often go on to work for land management agencies like the Forest Service or Fish and Wildlife Service, other nonprofits, or in leadership roles with ICC. There is also the opportunity to earn a Public Land Corps hiring authority upon program completion, which makes getting a federal job less competitive. Graduates of the program also gain access to our Alumni Network for career development and networking opportunities, and for staying connected with crewmates. Training varies, but may include chainsaw/crosscut certification, trail construction and maintenance techniques, conservation education, driver training, and more.

 About KBO 
Klamath Bird Observatory advances bird and habitat conservation through science, education, and partnerships.

Our program areas reflect the highest conservation priorities for reversing the decline of western bird populations and the habitats on which they depend. Our current applied ecology programs focus on improving management and restoration of conifer forests, oak woodlands, riparian habitats, and alpine meadows. Our theoretical research improves our understanding of historic, current, and future population trends of birds in those same ecosystems, and studies birds throughout their full annual life cycles to identify the limiting factors that birds face during breeding and non-breeding seasons. We bring our results to bear through science delivery involving partnership-driven engagement in conservation planning, informing the critical decisions being made today that will have lasting influences on the health of our natural resources well into the future.

Allied Whale (AW), the marine mammal research lab of College of the Atlantic and Bar Harbor Whale Watch Co. (BHWW) seeks 4 interns/research assistants for the 2025 field season. These are entry-level research positions designed to offer experience for individuals seeking to develop their professional careers in marine mammal research. One summer position (May 15 through August 31) and three full season positions (May 15 through October 15) are available.

Overview of position: This is a unique internship program in that the selected individuals will have the opportunity to participate and receive training in a wide range of marine mammal research activities Allied Whale while also working as a crew/scientist aboard commercial whale watching trips operating from Bar Harbor, Maine. Allied Whale currently supports field projects in the trophic ecology of humpback and fin whales, the ongoing housing and maintenance of the North Atlantic humpback and fin whale photo ID catalogs, an active stranding response program, and a research/education partnership with Bar Harbor Whale Watch Co. In addition, Allied Whale maintains the facilities on and conducts research from Mount Desert Rock, a remote offshore island. The interns play a critical role in the success of the field season and serve as support to all aspects of summer activities within both Allied Whale and Bar Harbor Whale Watch Co.

Description of duties: Upon arrival in May, all interns will receive research, boat crew, and Gulf of Maine natural history training by both Allied Whale and the Bar Harbor Whale Watch Company staff. As the Allied Whale field season does not begin until early June- the first several weeks will be focused on hands-on training of whale watch deckhand responsibilities, helping with boat maintenance, and assisting with whale catalog matching in the office or stranding response.

Once the season is in full swing, interns will rotate through shifts working as a Research Assistant/Deckhand (RA) for the Bar Harbor Whale Watch Co., shifts in the Allied Whale office, shifts at the Mount Desert Rock field station, and time off. Every week, schedules will be different and weather dependent. A typical week in June-August may include 2-4 days scheduled as researchers on Whale Watch vessels, 1-2 days scheduled in the office, and two days off (these days may or may not be consecutive). Weather may cause shifts to be canceled, and some weeks may be lighter in load or responsibilities.

 Below are specific expectations for each designated shift:

Whale watch trips: Research responsibilities on whale watch trips include searching for whales, photo-identification of whales, and behavioral data collection. Beyond research, RAs are responsible for assisting the naturalist in promoting education and conservation programs on each trip. In this, maintaining a positive, professional, and friendly demeanor while engaging whale watch passengers and fellow crew is necessary. Deckhand responsibilities include line handling, vessel cleaning, helping seasick passengers, and passenger safety. When whale watch trips cancel for weather, crew may be asked to report for duty to complete maintenance on the vessel or assist the lead naturalist with updating the Bar Harbor Whale Watch blog posts. 

Allied Whale office shifts: On scheduled office days, interns will be required to be available in the Allied Whale office from 9AM-4PM. During those hours, interns will match individual whales to our catalog, enter their whale watch data into the database, manage the Adopt-a-whale program, answer phone calls to the office, and be on call for assisting with response to strandings or necropsies. Interns schedule for office shifts will also be on call for boat research days.

Allied Whale boat research days: When weather permits, interns will assist Allied Whale staff and graduate students on trips offshore to collect biopsy samples of humpback and fin whales. While on board one of the research vessels, interns will be responsible for collecting photo identification of whales and recording data. Interns will be responsible for processing images from these trips. If schedule allows, RAs may also participate in an overnight trip to collect samples in Canada.

Mount Desert Rock: We hope for interns to also complete several shifts (each at least a week in length) at our offshore research station Mount Desert Rock. While on the island, interns will participate in land-based whale monitoring from the lighthouse tower, seal counts, gull counts, and maintenance/construction projects at the station. Interns will also receive experience working in a remote off-the-grid location. While on shift at Mount Desert Rock, RAs will manage standardized data collection on seals to contribute to a larger field station collaborative. This data will include seal counts and photography from the lighthouse tower and seal blind. Image analysis will be used to build a photo-identification catalog for seals and assess wounds/disease. RAs will also stay in contact with the BHWW office with sightings reports.

Pay/Housing: Those accepted to the program are able to earn income by their work with the Bar Harbor Whale Watch Company. Deckhands are paid $70 a trip (at the height of summer, there are 2 trips running a day). Interns also receive free First Aid Certification. Provided housing in downtown Bar Harbor is mandatory for a fee. Rent for the season will total approximately $2080 for summer interns and $2350 for full season interns. While at Mount Desert Rock, food is provided for free. **After August 31, if any of the summer interns are interested, they are welcome to work full time for the remainder of the season as crew for the BHWW as deckhand/galley on lighthouse trips, nature cruises, whale watches, and cruise ship tendering operations.

Qualifications: Applicants should have a college background or be currently enrolled as a sophomore or higher in a biology, ecology, and/or marine sciences program. Previous data collection experience in a research setting and/or knowledge of marine mammals are great advantages. While training will be provided and no prior boating/camera experience is required, time spent offshore or skills in photography are also assets. Due to Coast Guard requirements, all crew onboard US commercial vessels and therefore all research assistants/interns, must be US citizens or have permanent resident alien status.  Also, all interns will be drug screened prior to employment and will be enrolled in a random drug testing program.  Most importantly, applicants must be positive in attitude, flexible to quickly changing schedules, able to work independently, and be seaworthy/comfortable working on boats in rough or inclement weather. Lastly, because of the community living situation both in Bar Harbor and on Mount Desert Rock, applicants must get along well with others and be able to handle working in a team setting.

To apply: Please send a cover letter detailing your reasons for applying, a resume, and two letters of recommendation via email to alliedwhale.internships@gmail.com. Recommendation letters may either be sent with the application or directly from the references.

Please specify which position you are interested in (summer or full-season). Deadline of application is February 23rd.

Southeast Conservation Corps (SECC), a program of Conservation Legacy, is a non-profit, AmeriCorps-affiliated organization. SECC selects young adults, ages 18-30, up to 35 for veterans, to complete conservation service projects on public lands throughout the Southeast. SECC provides members with impactful opportunities through a unique set of programs that engage people in meaningful education and service to their communities and natural landscapes. SECC serves a diverse population that is representative of the Southeast, including youth, graduates, veterans, and a cross-section of ethnicities and income levels. SECC is also an active member of the AmeriCorps Disaster Response Team (A-DRT), and as such, selected crews may be deployed on Disaster response projects for up to 30 days.  
SECC partners with various land management agencies in Tennessee and throughout the Southeast region, such as the United States Forest Service, National Park Service, State Parks, city municipalities, and conservation-based non-profits. Projects vary but include trail construction and maintenance, ecosystem restoration, habitat restoration, fire fuels reduction, fencing on public lands, invasive weed removal, herbicide applications, and many others. The projects are manual labor based and most projects require a hike into and out of the project site daily carrying tools and a day pack.  
  Crews will serve in frontcountry and backcountry locations in all types of weather conditions. Schedules may vary, but generally are 9 days on and 5 days off for camping crews. Project days are 10-hour shifts with scheduled breaks throughout the day. Depending on project and location, other schedule variations may be implemented. While the staff at SECC strives to provide consistency throughout the season, personal flexibility is expected and should be prepared for when entering the term as schedules, times, and project locations are subject to change per project needs.  
  SECC is an independent, non-residential program. Crew Members are responsible for finding and attaining their own housing when not in the field. On-hitch crews prepare all their own meals and participate as a group to complete all necessary chores. Community/camp chores will be completed every evening, with many evenings including group discussions, conservation and/or corps related topics. Members must supply their own personal outdoor gear and equipment such as a tent, sleeping bag, sleeping pad, day pack, multi-day pack, work pants, hiking/work boots, etc. SECC will provide group camp equipment, tools, protective gear and transportation between SECC Office and project sites.

  Purpose: 
Southeast Conservation Corps (SECC) is a non-profit, AmeriCorps-affiliated organization. This individual placement is in partnership with the National Park Service and is an AmeriCorps Position.  SECC empowers young adults to cultivate compassion, responsibility, and grit through community service, and environmental stewardship.

SECC serves a diverse population that is representative of the Southeast, including youth, graduates, veterans, and a cross-section of ethnicities and income levels. 
  Cumberland Gap National Historical Park preserves the historic Cumberland Gap, a key point for crossing the Appalachians that became known as the First Gateway to the West. Located where Tennessee, Kentucky, and Virginia meet, the park’s 24,000 acres includes over 80 miles of hiking trails, front and backcountry camping, a historic Appalachian settlement, cave and rock formations, and 14,000 acres of managed wilderness.
The National Park Service preserves unimpaired the natural and cultural resources and values of the National Park System for the enjoyment, education, and inspiration of this and future generations. The National Park Service cooperates with partners to extend the benefits of natural and cultural resource conservation and outdoor recreation throughout this country and the world.
 Position Overview:

The individual placements will collaborate with African American community partners to identify priorities and co-create ways to interpret and share the park's African American history from that community's perspective.

The individual placements will help develop new programs, exhibits, digital content, or other products; boost park relevance to and engagement with new, diverse, and younger audiences; and support park efforts to ensure all visitors feel welcome.

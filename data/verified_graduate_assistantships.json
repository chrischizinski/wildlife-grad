Like other sturgeons, the life-history attributes of Lake Sturgeon (e.g., late age at maturity) make them vulnerable to overharvest and slow to recruit to the spawning population. Restoration of Lake Sturgeon populations requires effective management and long-term monitoring. Thus, information about the abundance, reproductive status, and spawning success of Lake Sturgeon provides useful information for species recovery. A cooperative effort between the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MN DNR) and the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and Parks (SD GFP) aims to return Lake Sturgeon to Big Stone Lake in the upper Minnesota River basin. Young Lake Sturgeon have been stocked annually by MN DNR in Big Stone Lake since 2014. Survival of these fish has been good for a number of year-classes, with some (older) fish now exceeding fifty inches. The goals of this project include evaluating the Lake Sturgeon population within the upper Minnesota River basin and assessing fish movements to evaluate the effectiveness of stocking and habitat restoration efforts. By evaluating movement and reproductive status of the Lake Sturgeon population, this study will help identify the importance of restored spawning areas as well as other potential habitats including juvenile/adult rearing habitats. \n\nStart date: Flexible, late May to late June 2025.\n\nTo Apply: Please include the following application materials:\n\n(1)   A 1–2-page cover letter describing your interest and experience related to the position.\n(2)   Current Resume and a copy of academic transcripts (unofficial copies are fine).\n(3)   Names and contact information for three references familiar with your background and work experience.  \n\nPlease email your application packet to Dr. Steven R.

MS Concentrations include Conservation Biology, Environmental Education, Advocacy for Social Justice and Sustainability, and several others. In Conservation Biology, students focus on gaining quantitative (GIS and statistics), writing, and ecological field skills. Students also gain experience with community engagement, social justice, and applied research and service.\n\nStudents often work with Antioch faculty in our existing research programs. Specifically in our Conservation Biology concentration, we have expertise in vertebrate ecology (e.g., birds, snakes), invertebrate ecology (e.g., estuarine invertebrates, insects), tropical ecology, forest ecology, alpine ecology, marine ecology, and coastal restoration. In some cases, faculty may have extramural funding to support students in seasonal field and lab positions, including research in New England and in the Caribbean. Students who are eligible for US federal work-study can work part time in various on-campus work-study positions, including Graduate Teaching and Research Assistantships and various positions in our numerous campus centers (e.g., Institute for International Conservation, Spatial Analysis Lab). However, you need to be accepted and taking classes as a graduate student to be eligible for these work-study positions. Students at Antioch generally pay for at least part of their own tuition, but we offer numerous university-wide grants and scholarships, which can help defray tuition costs, and which are detailed here: https://www.antioch.edu/admission-aid/financial-aid/scholarships-and-grants/ . We also work with students to help them apply for external scholarships, fellowships, and research-focused grants.\n\nStudents can earn their graduate degree with either face-to-face classes at the Antioch University New England campus in Keene, NH, USA, or fully online classes (that can be taken from anywhere) which are offered each semester, or with a mixture of the two. Ecological field trip classes (intensive 1-2 week trips to destinations abroad and in-country) are also available for all students. All classes are just 1-2 days a week, making this a viable program for environmental professionals working part or full-time. Our programs are student-centered, flexible, and tailored to meet your individual needs, learning style, and location.\n\nJoin our tight-knit community as we strive to advance social and environmental justice, conserve biodiversity, and mitigate climate change as a department and as a university!

Despite this, the status of most small mammal species in Oregon is uncertain. In Oregon’s State Wildlife Action Plan, several are identified as Species of Greatest Conservation Need (e.g., Western gray squirrel, red tree vole) while many others are recognized as Species of Greatest Information Need (e.g., Preble’s shrew). The most recent data we have on a state-wide scale to inform the conservation and management of small mammals in Oregon are records reported within “Land Mammals of Oregon” (Verts & Carraway, 1998). The long-term goal of this project is to update estimates of i) distribution, ii) abundance, iii) and habitat associations for a range small mammals statewide. A critical step towards this goal is developing capacity for large-scale sampling of small mammals, which requires a suite of non-invasive survey tools applicable to three key groups: i) arboreal species, e.g., Western grey squirrels, red tree voles, ii) terrestrial species e.g., Preble’s shrew, and iii) fossorial species e.g., pocket gophers. Optimal multi-method protocols will be developed through field and lab tests paired with simulations. Depending on students’ interests, there will be scope to develop research focused on any or all the key species and groups. This PhD will facilitate future statewide sampling of small mammals to inform conservation action for a range of species. \n This PhD program will involve extensive field work in western Oregon (planning, establishing, and running field trials using a combination of invasive and non-invasive methods including capturing small mammals) as well as quantitative model development. We will develop and test a suite of non-invasive sampling methods applicable to a range of small mammals and use simulations to produce optimal multi-method sampling protocols for arboreal, terrestrial, and fossorial mammals in Oregon. The student will join a growing and supportive lab group and work closely with project partners including state agency collaborators at Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, Oregon Biodiversity Information Center, and NCASI. The student will be expected to integrate as an active collaborator and facilitate project management. They will co-develop and implement a project-related dissertation under the mentorship of their advisor, Dr. Joshua P. Twining.  \n \n\n \nStart date: January 5th, 2026\n \n \n\nFunding: Fully funded, including 12 months of salary (~$30-33k) and covering the costs of tuition, fees, and benefits each year. The student will be supported through a combination of graduate research assistantships and employment as a graduate teaching assistant. \n Minimum requirements:  \n•      Applicants must meet the OSU Graduate School minimum requirements for admission (found at: https://gradschool.oregonstate.edu/admissions/academic-requirements).  \n•      BS in Ecology or an associated field by the expected start date. E.g., wildlife, conservation, biology, or allied fields. \n•      Strong quantitative base (e.g., statistical training, competency in R)  \n•      Aptitude and enthusiasm for fieldwork under variety of conditions \n•      Strong written and oral communication skills across different types of audiences.  \n•      Resilience and adaptability \n•      Ability to work both independently and collaboratively as part of a team \n \n\nPreferred skills and qualifications: \n•      MS in Ecology or an associated field by the expected start date. E.g., wildlife, conservation, biology, or allied fields  \n•      Demonstration of an ability to take projects from planning and implementation through to completion with written products (e.g., peer reviewed publications). \n•      Trapping and handling mammals \n•      Familiarity with genetic methods (e.g., microsatellite analyses, sanger sequencing) \n•      Hierarchical modelling (e.g., occupancy modelling, spatial-recapture recapture) \n•      Experience with Bayesian inference and familiarity with relevant software \n To apply: Please submit the following via email as a single PDF document: \n\n1.      Cover letter, less than 2-pages single-spaced (size 12 font) describing how you meet the minimum and preferred requirements for this role, your research interests and experiences, what you ultimately hope to do achieve within and after the PhD.  \n\n2.      A current resume or curriculum vitae \n\n3.      Transcripts (unofficial copy is okay for review, but official needed if selected) \n\n4.      The names and contact information of three academic or professional references  \n Email your application packet to Dr. Joshua P.

Our research on lynx and their prey in the Kluane region spans decades, and the current project combines lynx GPS telemetry, accelerometry, and acoustic tracking, with intensive snowshoe hare population monitoring and landcover mapping, to infer dynamic interactions between lynx, hares and their landscapes. The fieldwork spanned 4 winters through the peak-to-low phases of a lynx-hare population cycle, where hare densities underwent a 20-fold change and 23 lynx were instrumented and intensively tracked with >1000 hare kills being recorded. We are primarily interested in understanding how lynx vary their movements and resource selection in response to dramatic changes in the density of their primary prey, and whether dynamic behavioural responses allow lynx to overcome extreme variation in their environments. This rich dataset is ripe for testing a variety of basic and applied questions related to lynx foraging and movement ecology, and the postdoctoral fellow will have the opportunity to develop specific research questions within the scope of the larger project. For example, we also have abundant GPS telemetry and accelerometry data for snowshoe hares and can combine the lynx movement analysis with information on hare feeding, movement and habitat selection. Opportunities for graduate teaching and student mentoring may also be available. \n Successful candidates MUST have a PhD in Ecology, Conservation Biology, or related field, demonstrated evidence of peer-reviewed publishing (incl. as senior author), strong quantitative skills, and an interest in working collaboratively within a large and diverse research group.

Small class sizes and hands-on learning are the norm in both introductory and advanced Biology classes. We have a large array of modern laboratory equipment and unparalleled field resources.\n \nCOLLEGE/UNIVERSITY HIGHLIGHTS\nThe College of Saint Benedict (CSB), a liberal arts college for women, and Saint John's University (SJU), a liberal arts college for men, are located in the central lakes area of Minnesota, surrounded by more than 3,000 acres of pristine forests, prairies, and lakes. The campuses are minutes away from St. Cloud, an increasingly diverse regional center with a population of over 100,000, and 70 miles from Minneapolis and St. Paul. Some CSB/SJU faculty and staff choose to reside locally, while others commute from the Twin Cities. Both St. Cloud and the Twin Cities offer a wide range of fine arts, cultural, dining, recreational, and sporting opportunities.\n \nCSB and SJU are Catholic colleges in the Benedictine tradition enlivened by values of community, hospitality, stewardship, and justice. The schools are dedicated to cultivating an equitable, inclusive community founded on respect for all persons. Students, staff and faculty from many diverse belief systems and backgrounds collectively bring a rich dimension to the academic, cultural, and religious experience at CSB and SJU. We welcome faculty who devote themselves with passion and integrity to their disciplines and to a transformative education of their students. Please view our brochure regarding Higher Education in the Catholic and Benedictine Tradition.\n \nWith a total enrollment of approximately 2,900 students, faculty members develop relationships with students in small classroom settings and have opportunities to work closely with students on research projects, experiential learning experiences, and study abroad programs. Recent initiatives to create a dynamic general education curriculum and to develop plans for a new teaching and learning center demonstrate strong institutional support for faculty development.\n \nInstitutional Inclusion Visioning Statement\nThe College of Saint Benedict (CSB) and Saint John’s University (SJU) believe that an excellent liberal arts education requires an understanding and appreciation of cultural difference and that everyone deserves to feel safe and morally valued. To that end, we will challenge our own practices and systems. Our commitment to an inclusive environment will be incorporated into all decision-making processes. We dedicate ourselves to cultivating an equitable, inclusive community founded on respect for all persons.\n\nCSB and SJU offer competitive salaries and a comprehensive benefits program (click the benefits tab above the position summary section to view more information).

We contribute to generating sustainable solutions in the places where we live and work. SFS is part of a growing network of individuals and institutions committed to environmental protection.\n\nJob Title \n\nProfessor of Political Ecology\nReport to\n\nCenter Director, Center for Amazonian Studies\n\nDean, Office of Academic Affairs\n\nLocation\n\nTarapoto, Peru\nPeriod of Service\n\nAugust 1 to December 15, 2025\nCompensation/Benefits\n\nThis is a four-and-a-half-month contract for educational services. The amount of the contract will depend on the candidate's experience. On-campus room and board are included as part of the benefits.\n\nPosition Summary \n\nThe Center for Amazonian Studies, located in Tarapoto, Peru, is looking for an enthusiastic and team-based individual to teach in an interdisciplinary field study program aimed at undergraduate students from universities in the United States. The Faculty in Political Ecology will teach the fifty-hour course \"Political Ecology of Peru\" between September and December 2025. In addition, she will teach the \"Directed Research\" course together with two other professors and lead a research project related to Political Ecology with a small group of students.\n\nThe position will be in charge of classroom and field teaching.

Applications submitted through LinkedIn or Indeed will NOT be reviewed.\n\nOverview: The Santa Barbara County Fire Safe Council (SBCFSC) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization with a mission to unify public and private organizations in Santa Barbara County to educate, motivate, and coordinate to minimize negative impacts associated with future wildfires. Members of the Board include current and past firefighting professionals, representatives of local government, and citizen representatives from various local communities. The Board holds monthly meetings with the goal to provide relevant information to local citizens and offer a platform for community members to become active participants in the solutions to the challenges fire poses to our wildland urban areas.\n\nThe SBCFSC is funded through donations and grants, using these funds to increase wildfire preparedness through education, planning, and mitigation projects. Recent projects include the Lompoc Valley Wildfire Protection Plan (CWPP), Firewise USA®, Community Chipping, prescribed grazing, educational videos, and Wildfire Preparedness Expositions.\n\nSBCFSC Vision for Landscape Resilience: SBCFSC currently implements the novel Regional Wildfire Mitigation Program (RWMP) which provides a philosophical framework for a focal organization to facilitate a collaborative and holistic approach to wildfire resilience through built environment, landscape, and community programming. The goal for the landscape is to conserve and expand fuel buffers, particularly vegetated greenbelts, to protect communities and critical infrastructure from wildfire. Traditional fuel reduction projects for wildfire mitigation focus on removing or thinning fuels. However, to accomplish the above goal, SBCFSC seeks to focus on a more holistic and nature\nbased approach to wildfire risk mitigation fuels projects. We aim for most of our landscape based mitigation projects to have multiple benefits - soil erosion protection, biodiversity enhancement, ecosystem restoration, food security, environmental justice, workforce training - while planning for project sites to be self-sustaining over time and resilient to future climatic changes. There are several partner organizations doing similar work. The selected candidate will be expected to coordinate with partners to incorporate research into their existing or planned projects to help inform other practitioners and future work. While SBCFSC encourages research, it should be noted that this is not a research dominant position. The primary goal of this position is to implement nature based projects that reduce wildfire risk with a secondary goal of incorporating small, manageable, and cost-effective scientific studies into project plans.\n\nCurrent Landscape Work: SBCFSC currently manages a chipping, tag and trim, prescribed grazing, and defensible space programs. Additionally, we have some funds for community fuel buffers and habitat restoration. Projects that are accomplishing the above goal have already been started by our partner SIG-NAL. The candidate will be expected to continue maintenance and monitoring of existing sites and continue to seek and implement similar projects.\n\nPosition Opening: SBCFSC seeks well-rounded candidates with in-depth experience in applied landscape ecology, research, community outreach, relationship cultivation, and volunteer coordination. The candidate will lead the planning and oversee the implementation of nature based wildfire risk reduction projects for communities and critical infrastructure, incorporate research into existing SBCFSC and partner projects to better inform wildfire mitigation tactics, and provide a strategy for landscape resilience to wildfire. Specifically the candidate will:\n\nStrategic Planning: Conduct geospatial analysis to determine environmental and land-use policy suitability of landscape risk reduction strategies: shaded fuel breaks, orchard buffer rehabilitation, targeted grazing, xeric agriculture, and riparian conservation. Prioritize communities and critical infrastructure for implementation of landscape risk reduction projects. Coordinate with Santa Barbara County to build on existing agricultural geospatial mapping to identify additional vulnerability attributes at the parcel scale (e.g., water source). Partner with Santa Barbara County Fire to conduct prescribed fire suitability/feasibility analysis at the parcel scale.\n\nProject Planning: Actively seek and coordinate with partners and SBCFSC staff to identify locations for landscape risk reduction strategies. Coordinate with landowners on a project plan. Incorporate scientific best practices and use a multi-benefit, climate resilience approach to project plans.\n\nApplied Research: Work with partners to incorporate research into their current and proposed projects. Incorporate research into existing SBCFSC projects. Seek opportunities and coordinate with partners to incorporate research into their risk mitigation projects. Assist with SBCFSC project monitoring.\n\nPublication and Conferences: While publication is not the main objective of this position, SBCFSC does support and encourage contributions to science. The candidate may write and publish scientific articles/reports and attend conferences to share results and SBCFSC projects.\n\nFunding Support: SBCFSC has limited funding for project implementation. The candidate will seek funding through grants, contracts, or fundraising to continue implementation, maintenance, monitoring of current and additional fuel buffers and other landscape based projects.\n\nGIS and Spatial Analysis: Be the lead GIS staff member for the SBCFSC. Develop a public Project Tracker that maps fuels projects that communicate to the community and stakeholders planned, in-progress, and completed mitigation projects reducing wildfire risk in the County. Conduct spatial analyses to support all SBCFSC planning and prioritization efforts.\n\nStaff and Volunteer Oversight: Provide direct oversight to staff, interns, and volunteers to assist with project tasks. SBCFSC currently has a Program Assistant who will assist with project implementation, maintenance, and monitoring. SBCFSC also occasionally has GIS interns who, depending on the project, may report to the Landscape Ecologist. The candidate will mentor and manage interns and volunteers.\n\nRelationship Cultivation: Implemented projects will continue to need monitoring and maintenance for the foreseeable future. There will be a need to expand monitoring and maintenance capacity through volunteers or partnerships with other organizations/communities. Sit on working groups and committees that align with the vision of the SBCFSC. This candidate will also engage with the public and potential donors and will be expected to represent the values of the SBCFSC and share their passion for wildfire mitigation and conservation.\n\nField work: Implement restoration and research projects, including weed control, planting, mapping, and monitoring. Collect spatial data using Field Maps for ArcGIS, Avenza, etc.\n\nOutreach and Education: Work with SBCFSC staff to develop outreach materials, including newsletter articles, web updates, videos, press releases, and social media. Represent the Garden’s conservation program in regional and state meetings, and build a strong relationship with conservation partners. Share your passion for conservation with the public via lectures, workshops, nature walks, field trips, and other outreach events.\n\nMinimum Qualifications:\n•This position is being offered at the principal investigator (PI) level and requires a PhD from an accredited university in Conservation, Restoration, Environmental Science, Ecology, Fire Ecology, Botany, or equivalent degree.\n•Analyze data using modern statistical and modeling techniques\n•Excellent proficiency at R and ArcPro for conducting spatial analyses, data analysis, mapping, and data visualization\n•Design and implement original research projects\n•Give public presentations and perform other outreach to promote projects and engage the public and prospective donors\n•Quickly learn the California flora (if not already familiar) and use dichotomous keys and other resources to identify unfamiliar taxa\n•Be physically able to conduct field work in a remote setting with rugged terrain under a variety of environmental conditions. Work may include standing/walking for extended periods of time, bending, squatting, digging, and hiking rugged trails, and safely lifting and carrying 40lbs.\n•Experience supervising interns and/or volunteers\n•Experience managing budgets and tracking expenses.\n•Detailed oriented person who goes above and beyond\n•Proficiency in Microsoft Word, Excel, Powerpoint, and Google products\n•Excellent communication and people skills for shared leadership and coordination across teams and projects, community and stakeholder engagement, and proliferation of progressive resilience planning\n•Valid US driver's license with functioning vehicle – selected candidate will be required to drive their own vehicle; fuel stipend will be provided for project related activities\n\nDesired skills:\n•2+ years as a Principle Investigator (PI) or Co-PI\n•2+ years experience outside of academia\n•Familiarity with EEMS\n•Experience with fire modeling programs such as but not limited to, FARSITE, FlamMap, Behave\n•Experience with Python\n•Ability to communicate factors influencing wildland fire behavior and how vegetation treatments impact fire behavior\n•Familiarity with fundraising and donor relations\n•Experience with the California flora\n•Knowledge of prescribed grazing, prescribed burning, habitat restoration, and other wildfire mitigation activities\n•Fluent in both English and Spanish\n\nLocation: This is a Countywide program in Santa Barbara, California.

Quantifying zooplankton diversity and abundance is vital for monitoring ecosystem health, but traditional methods based on microscopy are labor-intensive and often provide limited taxonomic resolution. Metabarcoding offers promise of faster, cheaper, more accurate, and higher-resolution characterization of zooplankton biodiversity. However, these methods can be limited by primer biases, incomplete reference databases, and challenges in accurately reflecting organismal biomass. Shotgun metagenomics - sequencing all DNA present in a sample without the need for targeted amplification - may provide a more comprehensive and unbiased view of community composition. This approach has the potential to offer a more accurate estimate of relative abundance, but its performance and practicality for application on complex real-world tissue mixtures has not yet been validated. Accordingly, both metabarcoding and metagenomic approaches will need careful context-specific evaluation and benchmarking against traditional approaches prior to any large-scale implementation in monitoring programs. This position offers the exciting opportunity to assess the performance of these emerging techniques in a real-world monitoring program and help shape the future of aquatic ecosystem assessment.\n KEY RESPONSIBILITIES:\nThe project will generate side-by-side comparisons of results from metabarcoding, metagenomics, and traditional microscopy on samples collected by the Hudson River Lower Food Web Monitoring Program. The postdoc is expected to lead efforts in the following five areas:\n·      Design and refine experimental and laboratory protocols for DNA extraction and library preparation from bulk tissue and water samples\n·      Analyze high-throughput sequencing data and optimize bioinformatic pipelines for both metabarcoding and metagenomic workflows\n·      Build and curate taxonomic reference databases from public repositories and de novo sequencing\n·      Collaborate with partners and regional stakeholders and co-organize annual workshops to promote knowledge exchange\n·      Prepare peer-reviewed publications and presentations for both scientific and broader audiences\n DESIRED QUALIFICATIONS:\n·      A Ph.D. in molecular ecology, bioinformatics, evolutionary biology, environmental genomics, or a related field\n·      Demonstrated experience with metabarcoding, metagenomics, or other environmental DNA applications\n·      Proficiency in programming and bioinformatics tools for high-throughput sequence analysis\n·      Excellent organizational skills, attention to detail, and ability to work both independently and collaboratively in a team environment.\n·      Strong written and verbal communication skills\n·      Commitment to fostering an inclusive and supportive research environment\n            TERMS OF APPOINTMENT:\nThis is a full-time position starting in late summer 2025 (or as soon as possible thereafter). The initial appointment is for 12 months, with the potential for renewal based on performance and available funding. The position will be based in Ithaca, NY, in the Department of Natural Resources and the Environment at Cornell University. While on-site work is preferred, we offer some flexibility. Salary will be commensurate with experience and competitive. Our lab and Cornell University are committed to fostering a diverse, equitable, and inclusive environment. We strongly encourage applications from individuals of underrepresented and marginalized backgrounds.\n TIMELINE AND APPLICATION PROCESS:\nTo apply, please send a cover letter with a description of your motivation and interest in the position, along with your CV and contact information for three references to Nina Overgaard Therkildsen at nt246@cornell.edu.

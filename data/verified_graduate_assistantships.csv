Description
Overview 
The Forest Soils and Biogeochemistry Lab at Auburn University (AU) is seeking one PhD student and one MS student to perform research associated with soil biogeochemistry and forest health in the Southeast region. The two graduate students will work together and supervise undergraduates in the field and laboratory to 
1. Assess soil physicochemical properties and microbial activities under repeated prescribed fires and forest thinning 
2. Analyze existing, multi-decadal vegetation and litter data to explore plant-soil-microbe interactions in a changing environment 
3. Examine the impact of microplastic pollution on soil nutrients and microbes. 

The hired students are expected to join and lead a three-week field campaign in summer 2026. The team will travel to multiple field sites and research stations in the southeast (AL, GA, NC, SC) to collect and pre-process soil and litter samples. Samples will be brought or shipped back to AU for further laboratory analysis. Students are welcome to build their projects within the scope of soil health and nutrient cycling.

1. Conduct literature reviews and learn/develop experimental protocols 
2. Attend weekly or biweekly lab meetings to share updates and give comments 
3. Generate, organize, and analyze data 
4. Write and publish manuscripts in peer-reviewed scientific journals 
5. Present research findings at local, national, and international conferences 
 Minimum Qualifications 
1. BS degree in Forestry, Ecology, Environmental Science, Natural Resources, or a related field; MS degree is required if applying for PhD 
2. Meet admission standards for the Auburn University Graduate School (https://graduate.auburn.edu/); International applicants please visit https://graduate.auburn.edu/prospective-students/general-admission-requirements/ for English language score requirements 
3. Ability to work independently and with others as a team 
 Preferred Qualifications 
1. Ability to locate study sites/plots using GPS units and maps 
2. Soil, water, and vegetation sampling experience 
3. Soil geochemical and microbial analysis experience 
4. Quantitative skills and writing experience 
5. Valid driver's license (or ability to obtain one in several months) 
 Estimated Start Date and Stipend 
PhD student, January 2026, $26,500 per year + tuition remission and benefits 
MS student, June 2026, $23,500 per year + tuition remission and benefits 
Financial support is typically provided for four years for PhD and two years for MS, subject to annual evaluation.  
 About Forest Soils and Biogeochemistry Lab 
Research in the Forest Soils and Biogeochemistry Lab investigates the fate of carbon and other elements in forest soil and its surrounding environment to address soil conservation issues and develop sustainable practices. We integrate field measurements, laboratory experiments, and computational statistics to examine soil biogeochemical responses under warmer climate, shifted precipitation regimes, and disturbances in forest ecosystems. The lab consists of a main laboratory room, a soil texture room, two storage rooms with field equipment, and a shared walk-in refrigerator. The main laboratory room houses a Biological Digital Microscope, a Deionized Water System, a Shimadzu Total Organic Carbon Analyzer, an Electronic Thermostat Hova-Bator Incubator, an Isotemp Programmable Muffle Furnace, a Chloroform fumigation-extraction station, and a brand-new FlashSmart Elemental Analyzer.

Description
Law Clerk Program

Summer 2026 Law Clerkships will accept applications from July through Labor Day 2025.


About Us


Founded in 1971, Earthjustice has a distinguished track record of achieving significant, lasting environmental protections. We achieve this by hiring people who share a passion for justice and a healthy environment. We wield the power of law and the strength of partnership to protect people’s health; preserve magnificent places and wildlife; advance clean energy; and combat climate change. We partner with thousands of groups and supporters to take on the biggest, most precedent-setting cases across the country and have a distinguished track record of achieving significant, lasting environmental protections. We are here because the earth needs a good lawyer.


Earthjustice’s work is currently divided into three major areas:

Lands, Wildlife, and Oceans focuses on cases that protect endangered species, national forests, national parks, other public lands, water resources, and the oceans.
Healthy Communities focuses on cases that protect public health, prevent air and water pollution, and curb exposures to toxic chemicals, particularly in disproportionately impacted communities. Recently, our healthy communities work has also begun to promote sustainable food and agriculture and the rights of farm workers.
Climate and Energy focuses on cases that encourage the swift and just transition to clean energy while challenging the reliance on coal, oil, and other dirty fuels.

We welcome all interested law students from across the country to apply for a summer law clerk position. We expect that students will work proximate to or in an office where the program is located. In some limited instances, an office may hire clerks to work in an area that is outside that team’s geographic area, but still proximate to an Earthjustice office.


Please note the location preferences of each litigation team in their descriptions below.


Responsibilities


Summer law clerks will have the opportunity to work with several attorneys on case development and litigation strategy. Students may draft pleadings and briefs, do legal research, develop strategy and legal theories, gather evidence, and attend client meetings and court proceedings. Earthjustice’s summer law clerk program also includes various programmatic offerings, such as in-person and virtual seminars with attorneys and guest speakers on current environmental issues, interactions with other local and regional environmental groups, and a job interview workshop.


Compensation


Earthjustice summer law clerkships are paid positions. The total stipend amount will be dependent on any external funding a student secures, such as through their law school’s summer funding program. Earthjustice will provide a one-time stipend at the start of the clerkship in the amount of $1,320.00 per week, minus the total amount received from any other sources and applicable taxes. The summer law clerkship is designed to be 10 weeks long at full-time hours (37.5 hours/week).


You are welcome to pursue outside funding. The ability to secure outside funding will not be considered as part of the hiring process.


How to Apply


Eligibility: Candidates must be enrolled in a U.S. law school through fall 2026 (i.e., not graduating before December 2026) and be available to commit to 10 weeks during summer 2026. Summer law clerks must work from the U.S. during their clerkship.


Each Earthjustice litigation team participates in clerk hiring; candidates may submit applications to whichever and however many litigation teams they are interested. Please be prepared to respond to our September follow-up e-mail, requesting your ranked choice of the teams for which you have applied. Do not include such rankings within your Jobvite application.

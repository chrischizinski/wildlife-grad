Description
 Description: The Green Environmental Toxicology lab (Green Ecotox) in collaboration with the Davis Herpetology Lab (https://drewrdavis.com) in the Department of Biology at Eastern New Mexico University is accepting applications for a M.S. student interested in pursuing a thesis project beginning in Fall 2025 (with the possibility for earlier field work). This project will be part of a larger effort characterizing current distribution of the Rio Grande Cooter (Pseudemys gorzugi) and the influence of environmental, physiological, and microbiome factors contributing to their distribution throughout the Pecos River in New Mexico and Texas. This is a newly funded, two-year project in partnership with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. The student will participate in field work trapping turtles and collecting water samples for toxicological analysis. The student will also develop physiological assays to test tolerances of captured turtles toward abiotic factors such as temperature and salinity. Eastern New Mexico University is a federally designated Hispanic-Serving Institution in Portales, New Mexico, a small, friendly town with an affordable cost of living. Portales is located on the Llano Estacado and situated near the confluence of the southern Great Plains, Chihuahuan Desert, and Southern Rocky Mountains. The Green Ecotoxicology lab is a multidisciplinary lab synthesizing basic biology, behavior, ecology, and biochemistry to create an in-depth narrative on the negative effects of contaminants to both human and environmental health. The Davis Herpetology Lab is an active lab that examines multiple aspects of amphibian and reptile ecology and conservation using field, laboratory, and museum-based studies. 

 Qualifications: A B.S. in Biology, Toxicology, Physiology, Wildlife Ecology, or a similar degree, with strong academic credentials, is required. Applicants should be highly motivated to work on their research project, able to work independently, and capable of conducting fieldwork under challenging conditions. Students must also hold a valid driver’s license and a safe driving record. The applicant should display characteristics of success, including a strong work ethic, organizational and planning skills, grit, and excellent communication (oral and written). Competitive applicants will demonstrate experience conducting both field and laboratory research. The selected applicant will have to apply and be accepted to the ENMU Graduate School and Department of Biology (https://www.enmu.edu/academics/degrees-programs/graduate-programs/master-science-biology#program-details). 

 How to Apply: Interested applicants should send an e-mail describing their interest in joining the lab and specific career goals. Please include a copy of your CV, unofficial transcripts, and contact information for two references to corey.green@enmu.edu or drew.davis@enmu.edu (subject line = ‘ENMU MS Position – Rio Grande Cooter’). Applications will be reviewed as they are received. Full consideration will be given to all applications received before 1 August 2025.

Description
The Integrative Wildlife Conservation lab at Trent University, Ontario, Canada, in collaboration with the Lithops Research and Conservation Foundation, is offering a unique PhD project on the eco-evolutionary and conservation dynamics of Lithops spp., a genus of small succulent plants occurring in isolated colonies across desert landscapes in southern Africa. In the wild, Lithops are susceptible to human collection, habitat loss, and climate change, with many populations and species currently subject to high extinction risk. There are important knowledge gaps related to Lithops phylogeny and ecology that are currently impacting rigorous conservation status assessment and protection. Trent University is among only a handful of facilities worldwide housing Lithops plants and seeds originating from wild colonies, providing a truly unique opportunity to address integrative questions related to evolution, population genetics, and conservation biology in a controlled, rigorous and impactful context. The PhD project may include investigations related to genome sequencing, phylogenetics, evolutionary divergence, and linkage analysis, and adaptation to harsh environmental conditions, and the candidate will have the opportunity to develop specific research questions based on their interest and expertise. 

 Successful candidates MUST have an MSc in Biology, Genetics, Conservation, or related field, demonstrated evidence of peer-reviewed publications, strong lab and field skills, and an interest in working collaboratively within a large and diverse research group. Additional desirable qualifications include DNA sequencing, bioinformatics and GIS skills.  
 To apply, send a cover letter, curriculum vitae, unofficial academic transcript, and contact information for 3 references to: Dennis Murray (dennismurray@trentu.ca). 
 For additional details, see www.dennismurray.ca and www.lithopsfoundation.com. 
 The position will be filled as soon as a suitable candidate is found.

Description
Fully funded MSc and PhD positions with Dr. April Martinig at the Université de Sherbrooke

Start date: May 2026 or September 2026 (negotiable)

The pay: minimum $20,000 per year for 2 years for MSc and $25,000 per year for 4 years for PhD. In Quebec, tuition fees vary depending on your province or country of residence (net salary will be adjusted to cover tuition). Tuition waivers are available for international students. 

Students can tailor their research across three themes:

Tracking in the wild: Work with long-term datasets on red squirrels in the Yukon, exploring the demographic consequences of behaviour and movement. This project will involve fully subsidized fieldwork and collaboration with an interdisciplinary research team.
Meta-analyses: You will have the opportunity to conduct large-scale syntheses on a topic of your choice - from dispersal and behaviour to climate resilience, conservation interventions, or any other ecological or evolutionary theme that sparks curiosity. This project is ideal for those who enjoy identifying patterns across studies, asking big-picture questions, and working with data across systems.
Big data: Use cutting-edge movement datasets from global wildlife tracking networks (over 14 billion locations from 1,500+ species) to develop predictive models of animal responses to environmental change. Students will build skills in R, spatial analysis, and ecological modelling.

Minimum qualifications: BSc and research experience in biology (e.g., ecology, evolution, or environmental sciences), statistics, math, computer science, natural resources, or related fields. Applicants must be admissible to the Biology Department for a masters degree (minimum 3.0/4.3 GPA) or doctoral degree (completed MSc OR 4.0/4.3 BSc GPA). Knowledge of French is not mandatory (e.g., English theses are permitted). 

Competitive applicants will also have:  
🧠 Experience working with data in R, Python, or other coding languages 
✍️ Practice communicating science–whether through papers, blogs, posters, or presentations
🎤 Comfort sharing research with a range of audiences, both academic and beyond
🤝  Interest or experience in working alongside Indigenous communities, government agencies, or other partners

Consideration of applications will begin immediately and will continue until positions are filled. Applicants received by August 1, 2025 will receive full consideration. 

I welcome all applicants, including those who identify as belonging to equity-seeking groups, including (but not limited to) women, non-binary individuals, persons with disabilities, Indigenous/Aboriginal peoples, LGBTQIA+, visible minorities, and first-generation or otherwise non-traditional students.

Qualified applicants should email the following materials, as a single PDF file, with the subject line ""Join@NORTH"", to aprilmartinig@hotmail.com:
🌍 A cover letter (max 1 page) telling me which project area excites you, what you hope to get out of your degree, and a bit about your background. Please ensure you highlight your strengths or lived experiences related to equity, diversity, and inclusion; involvement in outreach, volunteering, or learned societies; teaching or mentoring experience; or any other extracurriculars that show what you bring to a research environment
📄 Transcripts (unofficial)
📚 CV outlining your experience 
📝 A writing sample – this could be a class paper, blog post, report, or anything that shows how you communicate
📞 Contact information (phone number and email) for 3 references: two academic and one non-academic (like a coach, employer, or community leader)

The advisor: Dr. April Martinig (she/her) is a wildlife ecologist whose research explores how animal movement and behaviour are shaped by changing environments. She specializes in spatial ecology, conservation biology, and behavioural ecology, with a particular focus on how anthropogenic pressures influence dispersal and space use. April is starting as an Assistant Professor at the University of Sherbrooke in January 2026. Before moving to Sherbrooke, she was a Banting Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of British Columbia Okanagan (2024-2025), an NSERC Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of New South Wales (2022-2024), and got her PhD at the University of Alberta (2016-2021).

The university: These positions will be based in the Département de biologie at the Université de Sherbrooke, located on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded W8banaki Ndakina Nation Territory (Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada). The Université de Sherbrooke is a francophone university, but knowledge of French is not mandatory. The ecology program at the Université de Sherbrooke is anchored by the Centre de recherche en écologie de l’Université de Sherbrooke, a dynamic research hub of 13 investigators and over 50 graduate students and postdocs. Graduate students contribute to cutting-edge projects on population dynamics, behavioural ecology, and ecosystem function, often working in collaborative,  multidisciplinary teams.

The location: Sherbrooke is Quebec’s 6th largest metropolitan area (20th largest in Canada). It's known for its rich cultural diversity and is considered one of the most affordable cities in Canada to live in. Sherbrooke offers numerous opportunities for outdoor activities, including skiing at Mont-Bellevue Park, hiking, and exploring the surrounding natural areas. It is also 1.5 hours away from Montreal, the largest city in Quebec and the 2nd largest city in Canada.

PhD Assistantship in Fisheries Science: Seasonal Movement, Habitat Use, and Reproductive Structure of Lake Sturgeon in Big Stone Lake, Minnesota/South Dakota

Department of Natural Resource Management | South Dakota State University

Application Deadline: February 20, 2025 (preferred)
Salary: $28,500-$30,500/y plus tuition waiver
Project Duration: July 1, 2025 to December 30, 2028
Education Required: M.S. degree in fisheries/aquatic sciences.
Experience Required: Fish movement; sturgeon biology/ecology; fish physiology.
Location: Department of Natural Resource Management, South Dakota State University, Brookings, SD
 

Project Description: Lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) populations have declined across much of their range in North America owing to factors that include overharvest, impoundment of rivers, and habitat loss. Like other sturgeons, the life-history attributes of Lake Sturgeon (e.g., late age at maturity) make them vulnerable to overharvest and slow to recruit to the spawning population. Restoration of Lake Sturgeon populations requires effective management and long-term monitoring. Thus, information about the abundance, reproductive status, and spawning success of Lake Sturgeon provides useful information for species recovery. A cooperative effort between the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MN DNR) and the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and Parks (SD GFP) aims to return Lake Sturgeon to Big Stone Lake in the upper Minnesota River basin. Young Lake Sturgeon have been stocked annually by MN DNR in Big Stone Lake since 2014. Survival of these fish has been good for a number of year-classes, with some (older) fish now exceeding fifty inches. The goals of this project include evaluating the Lake Sturgeon population within the upper Minnesota River basin and assessing fish movements to evaluate the effectiveness of stocking and habitat restoration efforts. By evaluating movement and reproductive status of the Lake Sturgeon population, this study will help identify the importance of restored spawning areas as well as other potential habitats including juvenile/adult rearing habitats. 

Start date: Flexible, late May to late June 2025.

To Apply: Please include the following application materials:

(1)   A 1–2-page cover letter describing your interest and experience related to the position.
(2)   Current Resume and a copy of academic transcripts (unofficial copies are fine).
(3)   Names and contact information for three references familiar with your background and work experience.  

Please email your application packet to Dr. Steven R. Chipps with “PhD Application” in the Subject Line. The committee will review applications until an acceptable candidate is found, with a preference for those received by February 20, 2025.

Description
Application deadline: Review of applications will begin on Monday, July 14th, 2025, and will continue until a suitable candidate is found.

Start date: Flexible, with Fall 2025 and Spring 2026 possible.

Project description and responsibilities: The selected individual will participate in collaborative research alongside USDA labs and universities to promote best management practices for honey bee colonies and foster a sustainable beekeeping industry. Projects will be primarily focused on applied honey bee research looking to help solve problems for commercial beekeepers. Examples of possible projects include evaluating new products or combinations of existing products in the field to control Varroa mites, investigating resistance to different Varroa treatments, or understanding the impact of surrounding landscapes on colony health. Due to North Dakota being the number one honey producing state housing numerous commercial beekeepers, projects will be primarily geared towards alleviating issues commercial beekeepers are facing on a large scale. 

Projects will be catered to the interests and experience of the selected individual, as well as the needs of the beekeeping community. The selected individual is also expected to take on a leadership role. This will include designing experiments, mentoring project personnel, and communicating results to stakeholders. Numerous opportunities will exist for working with commercial beekeepers and developing scientific as well as apiculture skills and experience. Publication of results in quality peer-reviewed scientific journals as well as beekeeper-focused publications is expected. Furthermore, the individual will be required to contribute to the collegial atmosphere of the Bee Lab, including through participation in collaborative research, guest lecturing, and public outreach.

Duration: Two and four years for M.S. and Ph.D. programs, respectively.

Salary range and other benefits: Starting salary of $23,000 and $25,000 for M.S. and Ph.D. programs, respectively, with opportunities for advancement depending on performance. The individual will be assigned a Graduate Research Assistant position that includes a full tuition waiver.

Required qualifications: An undergraduate degree in Biology, Ecology, Entomology, Horticulture, or related field from an accredited institution in the United States or an equivalent institution abroad is required to begin either program. The selected individual must meet eligibility requirements to work in the United States at the time of appointment. 

Desired qualifications: Preference will be given to students who demonstrate an ability to be punctual and pro-active with basic researching knowledge. Additionally, experience contributing to honey bee health research, as well as demonstrating key beekeeping management techniques, is ideal; however, finding an individual that is hard-working and collaborative is most important.

Application description: Complete applications must include: 1) one-page cover letter that addresses your experiences and goals with respect to this position as well as how you meet the required and desired qualifications; 2) curriculum vitae; 3) contact information for three references; and 4) copies of all post-secondary transcripts (unofficial transcripts are fine).

Application submission: All materials should be compiled as a single PDF document and submitted to Dr. Rogan Tokach (rogan.tokach@ndsu.edu). Please include ‘Graduate Student Opportunity’ in the email subject line.

Description
I am seeking a Masters student interested in pollinator ecology. We will be examining how pollinator diversity, abundance, and floral resource use change in response to wetland restorations. In collaboration with partner agencies and private landowners, we will monitor pollinator diversity and floral resource use as outlined in the National Protocol Framework for The Inventory and Monitoring of Bees and the Integrated Monarch Monitoring Program. Aerial netting and passive trapping methods will allow us to monitor for a large variety of invertebrate pollinators. Oregon has an extremely high diversity of invertebrate pollinators with over 650 documented bee species and 150 butterfly species. This research will enable effective land management practices from various restoration choices faced by land management agencies in the eastern Cascade ecoregion. 
 Prospective students interested in pollinator ecology are encouraged to apply.  The student will be paid as a teaching assistant with a $10,000 a year stipend and $7,000 in tuition remission. Applicants should have: a degree in ecology, entomology, biology or related discipline and experience in data analysis using GIS and/or R. Field experience is highly preferred. Applicants must have excellent English writing and verbal communication skills, as well as the ability to work with and lead a research team.

 Application Process:
Applications due on a rolling basis, with the position closing on July 31st.  Position would start September 2025.

Description
Antioch University is offering work study positions, if you enroll in the Environmental Studies Master’s program, and is accepting applications to start your MS degree during the fall semester (late August) of 2025. MS Concentrations include Conservation Biology, Environmental Education, Advocacy for Social Justice and Sustainability, and several others. In Conservation Biology, students focus on gaining quantitative (GIS and statistics), writing, and ecological field skills. Students also gain experience with community engagement, social justice, and applied research and service.

Students often work with Antioch faculty in our existing research programs. Specifically in our Conservation Biology concentration, we have expertise in vertebrate ecology (e.g., birds, snakes), invertebrate ecology (e.g., estuarine invertebrates, insects), tropical ecology, forest ecology, alpine ecology, marine ecology, and coastal restoration. In some cases, faculty may have extramural funding to support students in seasonal field and lab positions, including research in New England and in the Caribbean. Students who are eligible for US federal work-study can work part time in various on-campus work-study positions, including Graduate Teaching and Research Assistantships and various positions in our numerous campus centers (e.g., Institute for International Conservation, Spatial Analysis Lab). However, you need to be accepted and taking classes as a graduate student to be eligible for these work-study positions. Students at Antioch generally pay for at least part of their own tuition, but we offer numerous university-wide grants and scholarships, which can help defray tuition costs, and which are detailed here: https://www.antioch.edu/admission-aid/financial-aid/scholarships-and-grants/ . We also work with students to help them apply for external scholarships, fellowships, and research-focused grants.

Students can earn their graduate degree with either face-to-face classes at the Antioch University New England campus in Keene, NH, USA, or fully online classes (that can be taken from anywhere) which are offered each semester, or with a mixture of the two. Ecological field trip classes (intensive 1-2 week trips to destinations abroad and in-country) are also available for all students. All classes are just 1-2 days a week, making this a viable program for environmental professionals working part or full-time. Our programs are student-centered, flexible, and tailored to meet your individual needs, learning style, and location.

Join our tight-knit community as we strive to advance social and environmental justice, conserve biodiversity, and mitigate climate change as a department and as a university! For more information about our programs, visit our webpages (https://www.antioch.edu/academics/program-finder?_sft_focus=environmental-studies-sustainability ,  https://www.antioch.edu/academics/environmental-studies-sustainability/environmental-studies-ms/conservation-biology-es-ms/ ) or contact Melissa Baptiste, Admissions Counselor, at mbaptiste (at) antioch.edu.

Description
Ph.D. or M.Sc.- Graduate Assistantship in American Black Duck Movement Ecology
Department of Natural Resources Science, University of Rhode Island
 
Project title: Effects of shellfish aquaculture disturbances on American black ducks.

A graduate assistantship is available at the Ph.D. or M.Sc. level to study the spatial and movement ecology of American Black Ducks in southern New England. This project will hinge on the capture and marking of individuals with GPS transmitters and implementation of experimental shellfish aquaculture operations to determine the extent to which the presence of pseudo-aquaculture farms influences American black duck space use, energetic costs, and habitat selection behavior, and to quantify the importance of inland water sources to American black ducks responding to the presence of pseudo-aquaculture farms. We expect the results from this project to directly inform waterfowl management. This study is a continuation of a long-term effort between the university and state agency to understand the relationships between shellfish aquaculture and waterfowl ecology in Rhode Island.

Qualifications: Only hard-working, motivated, intelligent, good-natured persons interested in waterfowl ecology and movements need apply. Applicants must have completed an undergraduate degree in animal/wildlife biology or ecology, earned at least a 3.2 GPA, and must have excellent oral and written communication skills. Field experience with waterfowl capture and handling and operating boats is highly desirable. Experience with quantitative analysis and field research is required.  If applying for the PhD level assistantship, applicants who have successfully completed a relevant M.Sc. are strongly preferred and those applicants with only a BSc degree must have exceptional and relevant field experience to be considered. If applying for the M.Sc. level assistantship, applicants must have exceptional and relevant field experience to be considered. Ability to work collaboratively and to supervise research assistants and undergraduates working in the field is also required. Stipends are approx. $25,000/academic year dependent on graduate assistantship level, tuition is paid, and an additional summer stipend of approx. $18,000 is provided. Starting date is either January 2026 or September 2026.

To apply submit the following: a letter stating your qualifications and research interests, a resume or CV, unofficial college transcripts, and the names and contact information for 3 references by no later than 15 September 2025 (early application is encouraged) to:

Description
 Call for applicants for a PhD in Fisheries, Wildlife, and Conservation Sciences 

Department of Fisheries, Wildlife and Conservation Sciences, 

Oregon State University 

 Project title: Developing multi-method approaches for landscape-scale sampling of small mammals 

 Summary: The Twining Applied Quantitative Ecology Lab at Oregon State University is seeking a highly motivated PhD student to conduct applied ecological research focused on developing field and statistical methods for statewide monitoring of small mammal populations. 
 Position description: Small mammal populations are critical to Oregon’s ecosystems, with essential roles in the regulation of plant communities, as ecosystem engineers, and as a critical prey base to many predators. Despite this, the status of most small mammal species in Oregon is uncertain. In Oregon’s State Wildlife Action Plan, several are identified as Species of Greatest Conservation Need (e.g., Western gray squirrel, red tree vole) while many others are recognized as Species of Greatest Information Need (e.g., Preble’s shrew). The most recent data we have on a state-wide scale to inform the conservation and management of small mammals in Oregon are records reported within “Land Mammals of Oregon” (Verts & Carraway, 1998). The long-term goal of this project is to update estimates of i) distribution, ii) abundance, iii) and habitat associations for a range small mammals statewide. A critical step towards this goal is developing capacity for large-scale sampling of small mammals, which requires a suite of non-invasive survey tools applicable to three key groups: i) arboreal species, e.g., Western grey squirrels, red tree voles, ii) terrestrial species e.g., Preble’s shrew, and iii) fossorial species e.g., pocket gophers. Optimal multi-method protocols will be developed through field and lab tests paired with simulations. Depending on students’ interests, there will be scope to develop research focused on any or all the key species and groups. This PhD will facilitate future statewide sampling of small mammals to inform conservation action for a range of species. 
 This PhD program will involve extensive field work in western Oregon (planning, establishing, and running field trials using a combination of invasive and non-invasive methods including capturing small mammals) as well as quantitative model development. We will develop and test a suite of non-invasive sampling methods applicable to a range of small mammals and use simulations to produce optimal multi-method sampling protocols for arboreal, terrestrial, and fossorial mammals in Oregon. The student will join a growing and supportive lab group and work closely with project partners including state agency collaborators at Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, Oregon Biodiversity Information Center, and NCASI. The student will be expected to integrate as an active collaborator and facilitate project management. They will co-develop and implement a project-related dissertation under the mentorship of their advisor, Dr. Joshua P. Twining.  
 

 
Start date: January 5th, 2026
 
 

Funding: Fully funded, including 12 months of salary (~$30-33k) and covering the costs of tuition, fees, and benefits each year. The student will be supported through a combination of graduate research assistantships and employment as a graduate teaching assistant. 
 Minimum requirements:  
•      Applicants must meet the OSU Graduate School minimum requirements for admission (found at: https://gradschool.oregonstate.edu/admissions/academic-requirements).  
•      BS in Ecology or an associated field by the expected start date. E.g., wildlife, conservation, biology, or allied fields. 
•      Strong quantitative base (e.g., statistical training, competency in R)  
•      Aptitude and enthusiasm for fieldwork under variety of conditions 
•      Strong written and oral communication skills across different types of audiences.  
•      Resilience and adaptability 
•      Ability to work both independently and collaboratively as part of a team 
 

Preferred skills and qualifications: 
•      MS in Ecology or an associated field by the expected start date. E.g., wildlife, conservation, biology, or allied fields  
•      Demonstration of an ability to take projects from planning and implementation through to completion with written products (e.g., peer reviewed publications). 
•      Trapping and handling mammals 
•      Familiarity with genetic methods (e.g., microsatellite analyses, sanger sequencing) 
•      Hierarchical modelling (e.g., occupancy modelling, spatial-recapture recapture) 
•      Experience with Bayesian inference and familiarity with relevant software 
 To apply: Please submit the following via email as a single PDF document: 

1.      Cover letter, less than 2-pages single-spaced (size 12 font) describing how you meet the minimum and preferred requirements for this role, your research interests and experiences, what you ultimately hope to do achieve within and after the PhD.  

2.      A current resume or curriculum vitae 

3.      Transcripts (unofficial copy is okay for review, but official needed if selected) 

4.      The names and contact information of three academic or professional references

Description
 Position Description 

The Ortiz Lab at Cal Poly Pomona (www.cpp.edu) is looking for applicants for one Master’s position in the Biological Sciences department that will focus on our existing Urban Parrot Project. Project direction will be focused on utilizing LiDAR to determine vertical structure of urban parrot roosting habitat. Additional directions of interest include noise pollution as well as tracking released individuals to determine movement in our urban landscape. Previous topics that have been pursued include population estimates using visual and drone thermal imagery and habitat selection through remote sensing. 

About Our Research Lab 

The Ortiz Lab was established in 2020 and conducts research in urban wildlife and conservation education. Our wildlife research primarily utilizes non-invasive techniques to study our wild neighbors’ behavior, population, and habitat use in urban spaces through observational methods like surveys and camera trapping and computer software like GIS. It is important to us for our community members to gain an appreciation and awareness of wildlife and conduct work on research experiences in the classroom, K-12 teacher training, summer camp presentations and more. Each semester we aim to hold one outreach event in our community. Previous events include the Family Bird Festival and P-22 Day. Currently, we have 2 Master’s students, 8 active undergraduate researchers, and many committed volunteers to help achieve our research goals. Our mission is to promote healthy human-wildlife coexistence through engaging and inclusive education, outreach, and research opportunities in our local urban ecosystems for Cal Poly Pomona students and the community.  More information about our lab including our ongoing projects and our team can be found at www.janelortiz.com or ortizlab_cpp on Instagram. 

Desired Qualifications 

By the start date, candidates must hold a Bachelor’s degree in Biology or related major. Prior experience with GIS and drones is preferred but not required. The candidate must be an effective leader and able to work well with others as this is a large project that will require the assistance of undergraduate researchers, communication with community members, and detailed scheduling. The ability to conduct field work in urban spaces, standing and sitting for extended periods of time, and looking upwards for a period of time will be required. Excellent communication with advisor, committee, research team, and community partners, time-management skills, a strong work ethic, and attention to detail are also essential.

Description
 The Integrative Wildlife Conservation lab at Trent University, in collaboration with University of Alberta and Yukon Government, is offering a post-doctoral fellowship on Canada lynx movement and foraging ecology in Yukon. Our research on lynx and their prey in the Kluane region spans decades, and the current project combines lynx GPS telemetry, accelerometry, and acoustic tracking, with intensive snowshoe hare population monitoring and landcover mapping, to infer dynamic interactions between lynx, hares and their landscapes. The fieldwork spanned 4 winters through the peak-to-low phases of a lynx-hare population cycle, where hare densities underwent a 20-fold change and 23 lynx were instrumented and intensively tracked with >1000 hare kills being recorded. We are primarily interested in understanding how lynx vary their movements and resource selection in response to dramatic changes in the density of their primary prey, and whether dynamic behavioural responses allow lynx to overcome extreme variation in their environments. This rich dataset is ripe for testing a variety of basic and applied questions related to lynx foraging and movement ecology, and the postdoctoral fellow will have the opportunity to develop specific research questions within the scope of the larger project. For example, we also have abundant GPS telemetry and accelerometry data for snowshoe hares and can combine the lynx movement analysis with information on hare feeding, movement and habitat selection. Opportunities for graduate teaching and student mentoring may also be available. 
 Successful candidates MUST have a PhD in Ecology, Conservation Biology, or related field, demonstrated evidence of peer-reviewed publishing (incl. as senior author), strong quantitative skills, and an interest in working collaboratively within a large and diverse research group. Additional desirable skills include movement analysis, habitat selection analysis, processing GPS telemetry data, and remote sensing and GIS analysis. 
 Salary: $70,000 / year (CDN) plus research-related travel costs. The position is for a minimum of one year, with the opportunity for extension.  Start date ASAP. 
 To apply, send a cover letter, curriculum vitae, unofficial academic transcript, and contact information for 3 references to: Dennis Murray (dennismurray@trentu.ca).

SFS creates transformative study abroad experiences through teaching and field research. Our educational programs explore the human and ecological dimensions of the complex environmental issues faced by local communities. We contribute to generating sustainable solutions in the places where we live and work. SFS is part of a growing network of individuals and institutions committed to environmental protection.

Job Title 

Professor of Political Ecology
Report to

Center Director, Center for Amazonian Studies

Dean, Office of Academic Affairs

Location

Tarapoto, Peru
Period of Service

August 1 to December 15, 2025
Compensation/Benefits

This is a four-and-a-half-month contract for educational services. The amount of the contract will depend on the candidate's experience. On-campus room and board are included as part of the benefits.

Position Summary 

The Center for Amazonian Studies, located in Tarapoto, Peru, is looking for an enthusiastic and team-based individual to teach in an interdisciplinary field study program aimed at undergraduate students from universities in the United States. The Faculty in Political Ecology will teach the fifty-hour course ""Political Ecology of Peru"" between September and December 2025. In addition, she will teach the ""Directed Research"" course together with two other professors and lead a research project related to Political Ecology with a small group of students.

The position will be in charge of classroom and field teaching. Courses should contain as much fieldwork as possible. Teachers are also integral members of the Centre's educational community. Faculty live, eat, and work on campus with students. This role does not follow the nine-to-five working model.

Additional responsibilities include participation in visits to local communities, student life, laboratory organization and equipment care and general maintenance of the Center.

We are especially interested in individuals with experience teaching a diverse student body and a demonstrated commitment to diversity, inclusion, and cultural competence in a learning environment and in the Tarapoto community.

Center Emphasis:

The SFS Center for Amazonian Studies has a thematic focus on the complexity of this Andean-Amazonian region with its dramatic elevation gradient and diverse cultural elements.

This program seeks to understand the conflicts and synergies involved in the complexity of species and habitat conservation, as well as development processes. Students will gain a detailed knowledge of the richness of the Amazon region (biodiversity, social and cultural diversity, and ecosystem services) while exploring strategies to propose sustainable living alternatives in this highly productive and diverse region of South America.

Through our coursework and field exercises and directed research, students will analyze people's dependence on the environment, examine environmental and social media threats, and explore tools and strategies to mitigate these threats and promote well-being among communities. A strong component of this program is to examine the ecological patterns and processes that underpin the region's high diversity.

Institutional Position on Diversity and Inclusion:  

SFS was founded on the belief that caring for the planet is the responsibility of people around the world. Addressing complex global problems requires the active inclusion of stakeholders with different perspectives and identities. We recognize that in order to successfully address threats to our natural world, we must look beyond social constructs designed to divide us. Just as we value biodiversity in all its forms, we value and interact with a multitude of diverse perspectives and people in the countries where we work and the students and staff we serve.

Duties and responsibilities 

Teaching positions at SFS are different from many other university positions. Teachers are integral members of each school's model of community life. They work closely with the other faculty to teach an interdisciplinary program through education and field research. The days can be long and active. This position does not fit the nine-to-five working model. The position requires being at the height of high-quality, modern, experiential teaching on critical environmental issues within an interdisciplinary curriculum, and to participate fully in the implementation of the program's research agenda that addresses these issues. The publication of research results is critical. Each professor is expected to provide high-quality, research-based teaching and to guide students in their Directed Research projects defined in the research agenda of the Center for Amazonian Studies in Peru.

Description
All applications should be emailed to sbfiresafecouncil@gmail.com. Applications submitted through LinkedIn or Indeed will NOT be reviewed.

Overview: The Santa Barbara County Fire Safe Council (SBCFSC) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization with a mission to unify public and private organizations in Santa Barbara County to educate, motivate, and coordinate to minimize negative impacts associated with future wildfires. Members of the Board include current and past firefighting professionals, representatives of local government, and citizen representatives from various local communities. The Board holds monthly meetings with the goal to provide relevant information to local citizens and offer a platform for community members to become active participants in the solutions to the challenges fire poses to our wildland urban areas.

The SBCFSC is funded through donations and grants, using these funds to increase wildfire preparedness through education, planning, and mitigation projects. Recent projects include the Lompoc Valley Wildfire Protection Plan (CWPP), Firewise USA®, Community Chipping, prescribed grazing, educational videos, and Wildfire Preparedness Expositions.

SBCFSC Vision for Landscape Resilience: SBCFSC currently implements the novel Regional Wildfire Mitigation Program (RWMP) which provides a philosophical framework for a focal organization to facilitate a collaborative and holistic approach to wildfire resilience through built environment, landscape, and community programming. The goal for the landscape is to conserve and expand fuel buffers, particularly vegetated greenbelts, to protect communities and critical infrastructure from wildfire. Traditional fuel reduction projects for wildfire mitigation focus on removing or thinning fuels. However, to accomplish the above goal, SBCFSC seeks to focus on a more holistic and nature
based approach to wildfire risk mitigation fuels projects. We aim for most of our landscape based mitigation projects to have multiple benefits - soil erosion protection, biodiversity enhancement, ecosystem restoration, food security, environmental justice, workforce training - while planning for project sites to be self-sustaining over time and resilient to future climatic changes. There are several partner organizations doing similar work. The selected candidate will be expected to coordinate with partners to incorporate research into their existing or planned projects to help inform other practitioners and future work. While SBCFSC encourages research, it should be noted that this is not a research dominant position. The primary goal of this position is to implement nature based projects that reduce wildfire risk with a secondary goal of incorporating small, manageable, and cost-effective scientific studies into project plans.

Current Landscape Work: SBCFSC currently manages a chipping, tag and trim, prescribed grazing, and defensible space programs. Additionally, we have some funds for community fuel buffers and habitat restoration. Projects that are accomplishing the above goal have already been started by our partner SIG-NAL. The candidate will be expected to continue maintenance and monitoring of existing sites and continue to seek and implement similar projects.

Position Opening: SBCFSC seeks well-rounded candidates with in-depth experience in applied landscape ecology, research, community outreach, relationship cultivation, and volunteer coordination. The candidate will lead the planning and oversee the implementation of nature based wildfire risk reduction projects for communities and critical infrastructure, incorporate research into existing SBCFSC and partner projects to better inform wildfire mitigation tactics, and provide a strategy for landscape resilience to wildfire. Specifically the candidate will:

Strategic Planning: Conduct geospatial analysis to determine environmental and land-use policy suitability of landscape risk reduction strategies: shaded fuel breaks, orchard buffer rehabilitation, targeted grazing, xeric agriculture, and riparian conservation. Prioritize communities and critical infrastructure for implementation of landscape risk reduction projects. Coordinate with Santa Barbara County to build on existing agricultural geospatial mapping to identify additional vulnerability attributes at the parcel scale (e.g., water source). Partner with Santa Barbara County Fire to conduct prescribed fire suitability/feasibility analysis at the parcel scale.

Project Planning: Actively seek and coordinate with partners and SBCFSC staff to identify locations for landscape risk reduction strategies. Coordinate with landowners on a project plan. Incorporate scientific best practices and use a multi-benefit, climate resilience approach to project plans.

Applied Research: Work with partners to incorporate research into their current and proposed projects. Incorporate research into existing SBCFSC projects. Seek opportunities and coordinate with partners to incorporate research into their risk mitigation projects. Assist with SBCFSC project monitoring.

Publication and Conferences: While publication is not the main objective of this position, SBCFSC does support and encourage contributions to science. The candidate may write and publish scientific articles/reports and attend conferences to share results and SBCFSC projects.

Funding Support: SBCFSC has limited funding for project implementation. The candidate will seek funding through grants, contracts, or fundraising to continue implementation, maintenance, monitoring of current and additional fuel buffers and other landscape based projects.

GIS and Spatial Analysis: Be the lead GIS staff member for the SBCFSC. Develop a public Project Tracker that maps fuels projects that communicate to the community and stakeholders planned, in-progress, and completed mitigation projects reducing wildfire risk in the County. Conduct spatial analyses to support all SBCFSC planning and prioritization efforts.

Staff and Volunteer Oversight: Provide direct oversight to staff, interns, and volunteers to assist with project tasks. SBCFSC currently has a Program Assistant who will assist with project implementation, maintenance, and monitoring. SBCFSC also occasionally has GIS interns who, depending on the project, may report to the Landscape Ecologist. The candidate will mentor and manage interns and volunteers.

Relationship Cultivation: Implemented projects will continue to need monitoring and maintenance for the foreseeable future. There will be a need to expand monitoring and maintenance capacity through volunteers or partnerships with other organizations/communities. Sit on working groups and committees that align with the vision of the SBCFSC. This candidate will also engage with the public and potential donors and will be expected to represent the values of the SBCFSC and share their passion for wildfire mitigation and conservation.

Field work: Implement restoration and research projects, including weed control, planting, mapping, and monitoring. Collect spatial data using Field Maps for ArcGIS, Avenza, etc.

Outreach and Education: Work with SBCFSC staff to develop outreach materials, including newsletter articles, web updates, videos, press releases, and social media. Represent the Garden’s conservation program in regional and state meetings, and build a strong relationship with conservation partners. Share your passion for conservation with the public via lectures, workshops, nature walks, field trips, and other outreach events.

Minimum Qualifications:
•This position is being offered at the principal investigator (PI) level and requires a PhD from an accredited university in Conservation, Restoration, Environmental Science, Ecology, Fire Ecology, Botany, or equivalent degree.
•Analyze data using modern statistical and modeling techniques
•Excellent proficiency at R and ArcPro for conducting spatial analyses, data analysis, mapping, and data visualization
•Design and implement original research projects
•Give public presentations and perform other outreach to promote projects and engage the public and prospective donors
•Quickly learn the California flora (if not already familiar) and use dichotomous keys and other resources to identify unfamiliar taxa
•Be physically able to conduct field work in a remote setting with rugged terrain under a variety of environmental conditions. Work may include standing/walking for extended periods of time, bending, squatting, digging, and hiking rugged trails, and safely lifting and carrying 40lbs.
•Experience supervising interns and/or volunteers
•Experience managing budgets and tracking expenses.
•Detailed oriented person who goes above and beyond
•Proficiency in Microsoft Word, Excel, Powerpoint, and Google products
•Excellent communication and people skills for shared leadership and coordination across teams and projects, community and stakeholder engagement, and proliferation of progressive resilience planning
•Valid US driver's license with functioning vehicle – selected candidate will be required to drive their own vehicle; fuel stipend will be provided for project related activities

Desired skills:
•2+ years as a Principle Investigator (PI) or Co-PI
•2+ years experience outside of academia
•Familiarity with EEMS
•Experience with fire modeling programs such as but not limited to, FARSITE, FlamMap, Behave

Description
OVERVIEW:
The laboratory of Nina Overgaard Therkildsen at Cornell University is seeking a highly motivated postdoctoral to lead a project exploring the use of DNA-based methods to monitor lower food web dynamics. Quantifying zooplankton diversity and abundance is vital for monitoring ecosystem health, but traditional methods based on microscopy are labor-intensive and often provide limited taxonomic resolution. Metabarcoding offers promise of faster, cheaper, more accurate, and higher-resolution characterization of zooplankton biodiversity. However, these methods can be limited by primer biases, incomplete reference databases, and challenges in accurately reflecting organismal biomass. Shotgun metagenomics - sequencing all DNA present in a sample without the need for targeted amplification - may provide a more comprehensive and unbiased view of community composition. This approach has the potential to offer a more accurate estimate of relative abundance, but its performance and practicality for application on complex real-world tissue mixtures has not yet been validated. Accordingly, both metabarcoding and metagenomic approaches will need careful context-specific evaluation and benchmarking against traditional approaches prior to any large-scale implementation in monitoring programs. This position offers the exciting opportunity to assess the performance of these emerging techniques in a real-world monitoring program and help shape the future of aquatic ecosystem assessment.
 KEY RESPONSIBILITIES:
The project will generate side-by-side comparisons of results from metabarcoding, metagenomics, and traditional microscopy on samples collected by the Hudson River Lower Food Web Monitoring Program. The postdoc is expected to lead efforts in the following five areas:
·      Design and refine experimental and laboratory protocols for DNA extraction and library preparation from bulk tissue and water samples
·      Analyze high-throughput sequencing data and optimize bioinformatic pipelines for both metabarcoding and metagenomic workflows
·      Build and curate taxonomic reference databases from public repositories and de novo sequencing
·      Collaborate with partners and regional stakeholders and co-organize annual workshops to promote knowledge exchange
·      Prepare peer-reviewed publications and presentations for both scientific and broader audiences
 DESIRED QUALIFICATIONS:
·      A Ph.D. in molecular ecology, bioinformatics, evolutionary biology, environmental genomics, or a related field
·      Demonstrated experience with metabarcoding, metagenomics, or other environmental DNA applications
·      Proficiency in programming and bioinformatics tools for high-throughput sequence analysis
·      Excellent organizational skills, attention to detail, and ability to work both independently and collaboratively in a team environment.
·      Strong written and verbal communication skills
·      Commitment to fostering an inclusive and supportive research environment
            TERMS OF APPOINTMENT:
This is a full-time position starting in late summer 2025 (or as soon as possible thereafter). The initial appointment is for 12 months, with the potential for renewal based on performance and available funding. The position will be based in Ithaca, NY, in the Department of Natural Resources and the Environment at Cornell University. While on-site work is preferred, we offer some flexibility.

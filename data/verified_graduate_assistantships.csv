 Description: The Green Environmental Toxicology lab (Green Ecotox) in collaboration with the Davis Herpetology Lab (https://drewrdavis.com) in the Department of Biology at Eastern New Mexico University is accepting applications for a M.S. student interested in pursuing a thesis project beginning in Fall 2025 (with the possibility for earlier field work). This project will be part of a larger effort characterizing current distribution of the Rio Grande Cooter (Pseudemys gorzugi) and the influence of environmental, physiological, and microbiome factors contributing to their distribution throughout the Pecos River in New Mexico and Texas. This is a newly funded, two-year project in partnership with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. The student will participate in field work trapping turtles and collecting water samples for toxicological analysis. The student will also develop physiological assays to test tolerances of captured turtles toward abiotic factors such as temperature and salinity. Eastern New Mexico University is a federally designated Hispanic-Serving Institution in Portales, New Mexico, a small, friendly town with an affordable cost of living. Portales is located on the Llano Estacado and situated near the confluence of the southern Great Plains, Chihuahuan Desert, and Southern Rocky Mountains. The Green Ecotoxicology lab is a multidisciplinary lab synthesizing basic biology, behavior, ecology, and biochemistry to create an in-depth narrative on the negative effects of contaminants to both human and environmental health. The Davis Herpetology Lab is an active lab that examines multiple aspects of amphibian and reptile ecology and conservation using field, laboratory, and museum-based studies. 

 Qualifications: A B.S. in Biology, Toxicology, Physiology, Wildlife Ecology, or a similar degree, with strong academic credentials, is required. Applicants should be highly motivated to work on their research project, able to work independently, and capable of conducting fieldwork under challenging conditions. Students must also hold a valid driver’s license and a safe driving record. The applicant should display characteristics of success, including a strong work ethic, organizational and planning skills, grit, and excellent communication (oral and written). Competitive applicants will demonstrate experience conducting both field and laboratory research. The selected applicant will have to apply and be accepted to the ENMU Graduate School and Department of Biology (https://www.enmu.edu/academics/degrees-programs/graduate-programs/master-science-biology#program-details). 

 How to Apply: Interested applicants should send an e-mail describing their interest in joining the lab and specific career goals.

The focal project will be to sample arthropods from high-elevation sites in the Ouachita Mountains of Arkansas and Oklahoma, employ high-throughput DNA barcoding methods to uncover biodiversity patterns, and relate those patterns to environmental variables and ecosystem function.  Prospective applicants should have research interests in entomology, ecology, and evolutionary biology, and should have strong field, lab, and analytical skills.  Applicants with previous experience using molecular techniques (e.g., PCR, NGS library preparation, metabarcoding, etc.) and bioinformatics are preferred.  Experience with GIS and/or R is also desirable. 
 Financial support will be provided through a combination of teaching and research assistantships.  Assistantships come with a full tuition (not fees) waiver and 67% of the student health insurance paid for by the university.  The selected applicant would need to be admitted to a Ph.D. program at the University of Arkansas for the Spring 2026 semester, which begins January 12, 2026.  Students admitted to a Ph.D. program may also be eligible for a U of A Doctoral Fellowship that adds to their assistantship stipend for 4 years.  More information about these fellowships can be found at: https://graduate-students.uark.edu/cost-and-funding/index.php.  Note that applications for these fellowships require the GRE General Test even if it is not required for admission to a graduate program.  Applicants who would be competitive for a doctoral fellowship will be viewed favorably.  Continued support will be contingent on satisfactory performance and progress. 
 Research in the Forest Ecology & Health Lab uses field experiments and naturally occurring environmental gradients to examine how biogeochemistry and nutrients impact community structure and trophic interactions among soil arthropods and ant species primarily in forest ecosystems.  This project is in collaboration with Dr. Donald Shepard in the University of Arkansas, Department of Biological Sciences, and Dr. Ashley Dowling in the University of Arkansas, Department of Entomology and Plant Pathology.  More information about their research and labs can be found at: https://shepardlab.wixsite.com/home and https://adowling.hosted.uark.edu/index.html.  Information about the Ph.D. in Entomology program and its requirements is provided here: https://enpl.uark.edu/programs/phd-program.php. Depending on their interests and goals, the selected applicant may have the option to apply through the Ph.D. in Biology program: https://biology.uark.edu/academics/graduate/index.php. 
 To apply, send an email to Dr. Natalie Clay (nclay@uark.edu) that includes as attachments: 1) a cover letter expressing your interest and highlighting your qualifications for the position as well as your future career goals, 2) your curriculum vitae, 3) an unofficial copy of your college transcripts, and 4) names and contact information for three professional references.  To receive full consideration, submit your application by August 1, 2025; however, applications will be considered until the position is filled.  Note: the selected applicant will still need to apply to and be accepted into a Ph.D. program at the University of Arkansas.  The application deadline for Spring 2026 admission is September 1 for Entomology and October 1 for Biology.  Please email Dr. Clay (nclay@uark.edu) with any questions or concerns about the project/position.

Description
Fully funded MSc and PhD positions with Dr. April Martinig at the Université de Sherbrooke

Start date: May 2026 or September 2026 (negotiable)

The pay: minimum $20,000 per year for 2 years for MSc and $25,000 per year for 4 years for PhD. In Quebec, tuition fees vary depending on your province or country of residence (net salary will be adjusted to cover tuition). Tuition waivers are available for international students. 

Students can tailor their research across three themes:

Tracking in the wild: Work with long-term datasets on red squirrels in the Yukon, exploring the demographic consequences of behaviour and movement. This project will involve fully subsidized fieldwork and collaboration with an interdisciplinary research team.

Description
Application deadline: Review of applications will begin on Monday, July 14th, 2025, and will continue until a suitable candidate is found.

Start date: Flexible, with Fall 2025 and Spring 2026 possible.

Project description and responsibilities: The selected individual will participate in collaborative research alongside USDA labs and universities to promote best management practices for honey bee colonies and foster a sustainable beekeeping industry. Projects will be primarily focused on applied honey bee research looking to help solve problems for commercial beekeepers. Examples of possible projects include evaluating new products or combinations of existing products in the field to control Varroa mites, investigating resistance to different Varroa treatments, or understanding the impact of surrounding landscapes on colony health. Due to North Dakota being the number one honey producing state housing numerous commercial beekeepers, projects will be primarily geared towards alleviating issues commercial beekeepers are facing on a large scale. 

Projects will be catered to the interests and experience of the selected individual, as well as the needs of the beekeeping community. The selected individual is also expected to take on a leadership role. This will include designing experiments, mentoring project personnel, and communicating results to stakeholders. Numerous opportunities will exist for working with commercial beekeepers and developing scientific as well as apiculture skills and experience. Publication of results in quality peer-reviewed scientific journals as well as beekeeper-focused publications is expected. Furthermore, the individual will be required to contribute to the collegial atmosphere of the Bee Lab, including through participation in collaborative research, guest lecturing, and public outreach.

Duration: Two and four years for M.S. and Ph.D. programs, respectively.

Salary range and other benefits: Starting salary of $23,000 and $25,000 for M.S. and Ph.D. programs, respectively, with opportunities for advancement depending on performance. The individual will be assigned a Graduate Research Assistant position that includes a full tuition waiver.

Required qualifications: An undergraduate degree in Biology, Ecology, Entomology, Horticulture, or related field from an accredited institution in the United States or an equivalent institution abroad is required to begin either program. The selected individual must meet eligibility requirements to work in the United States at the time of appointment. 

Desired qualifications: Preference will be given to students who demonstrate an ability to be punctual and pro-active with basic researching knowledge. Additionally, experience contributing to honey bee health research, as well as demonstrating key beekeeping management techniques, is ideal; however, finding an individual that is hard-working and collaborative is most important.

Description
I am seeking a Masters student interested in pollinator ecology. We will be examining how pollinator diversity, abundance, and floral resource use change in response to wetland restorations. In collaboration with partner agencies and private landowners, we will monitor pollinator diversity and floral resource use as outlined in the National Protocol Framework for The Inventory and Monitoring of Bees and the Integrated Monarch Monitoring Program. Aerial netting and passive trapping methods will allow us to monitor for a large variety of invertebrate pollinators. Oregon has an extremely high diversity of invertebrate pollinators with over 650 documented bee species and 150 butterfly species. This research will enable effective land management practices from various restoration choices faced by land management agencies in the eastern Cascade ecoregion. 
 Prospective students interested in pollinator ecology are encouraged to apply.  The student will be paid as a teaching assistant with a $10,000 a year stipend and $7,000 in tuition remission. Applicants should have: a degree in ecology, entomology, biology or related discipline and experience in data analysis using GIS and/or R. Field experience is highly preferred. Applicants must have excellent English writing and verbal communication skills, as well as the ability to work with and lead a research team.

 Application Process:
Applications due on a rolling basis, with the position closing on July 31st.  Position would start September 2025.

Description
Antioch University is offering work study positions, if you enroll in the Environmental Studies Master’s program, and is accepting applications to start your MS degree during the fall semester (late August) of 2025. MS Concentrations include Conservation Biology, Environmental Education, Advocacy for Social Justice and Sustainability, and several others. In Conservation Biology, students focus on gaining quantitative (GIS and statistics), writing, and ecological field skills. Students also gain experience with community engagement, social justice, and applied research and service.

Students often work with Antioch faculty in our existing research programs. Specifically in our Conservation Biology concentration, we have expertise in vertebrate ecology (e.g., birds, snakes), invertebrate ecology (e.g., estuarine invertebrates, insects), tropical ecology, forest ecology, alpine ecology, marine ecology, and coastal restoration. In some cases, faculty may have extramural funding to support students in seasonal field and lab positions, including research in New England and in the Caribbean. Students who are eligible for US federal work-study can work part time in various on-campus work-study positions, including Graduate Teaching and Research Assistantships and various positions in our numerous campus centers (e.g., Institute for International Conservation, Spatial Analysis Lab). However, you need to be accepted and taking classes as a graduate student to be eligible for these work-study positions. Students at Antioch generally pay for at least part of their own tuition, but we offer numerous university-wide grants and scholarships, which can help defray tuition costs, and which are detailed here: https://www.antioch.edu/admission-aid/financial-aid/scholarships-and-grants/ . We also work with students to help them apply for external scholarships, fellowships, and research-focused grants.

Students can earn their graduate degree with either face-to-face classes at the Antioch University New England campus in Keene, NH, USA, or fully online classes (that can be taken from anywhere) which are offered each semester, or with a mixture of the two. Ecological field trip classes (intensive 1-2 week trips to destinations abroad and in-country) are also available for all students. All classes are just 1-2 days a week, making this a viable program for environmental professionals working part or full-time. Our programs are student-centered, flexible, and tailored to meet your individual needs, learning style, and location.

Join our tight-knit community as we strive to advance social and environmental justice, conserve biodiversity, and mitigate climate change as a department and as a university! For more information about our programs, visit our webpages (https://www.antioch.edu/academics/program-finder?_sft_focus=environmental-studies-sustainability ,  https://www.antioch.edu/academics/environmental-studies-sustainability/environmental-studies-ms/conservation-biology-es-ms/ ) or contact Melissa Baptiste, Admissions Counselor, at mbaptiste (at) antioch.edu.

Description
Ph.D. or M.Sc.- Graduate Assistantship in American Black Duck Movement Ecology
Department of Natural Resources Science, University of Rhode Island
 
Project title: Effects of shellfish aquaculture disturbances on American black ducks.

A graduate assistantship is available at the Ph.D. or M.Sc. level to study the spatial and movement ecology of American Black Ducks in southern New England. This project will hinge on the capture and marking of individuals with GPS transmitters and implementation of experimental shellfish aquaculture operations to determine the extent to which the presence of pseudo-aquaculture farms influences American black duck space use, energetic costs, and habitat selection behavior, and to quantify the importance of inland water sources to American black ducks responding to the presence of pseudo-aquaculture farms. We expect the results from this project to directly inform waterfowl management. This study is a continuation of a long-term effort between the university and state agency to understand the relationships between shellfish aquaculture and waterfowl ecology in Rhode Island.

Qualifications: Only hard-working, motivated, intelligent, good-natured persons interested in waterfowl ecology and movements need apply.

Department of Natural Resources Science, University of Rhode Island
 
Project title: Effects of shellfish aquaculture disturbances on American black ducks.

A graduate assistantship is available at the Ph.D. or M.Sc. level to study the spatial and movement ecology of American Black Ducks in southern New England. This project will hinge on the capture and marking of individuals with GPS transmitters and implementation of experimental shellfish aquaculture operations to determine the extent to which the presence of pseudo-aquaculture farms influences American black duck space use, energetic costs, and habitat selection behavior, and to quantify the importance of inland water sources to American black ducks responding to the presence of pseudo-aquaculture farms. We expect the results from this project to directly inform waterfowl management. This study is a continuation of a long-term effort between the university and state agency to understand the relationships between shellfish aquaculture and waterfowl ecology in Rhode Island.

Qualifications: Only hard-working, motivated, intelligent, good-natured persons interested in waterfowl ecology and movements need apply. Applicants must have completed an undergraduate degree in animal/wildlife biology or ecology, earned at least a 3.2 GPA, and must have excellent oral and written communication skills.

 Call for applicants for a PhD in Fisheries, Wildlife, and Conservation Sciences 

Department of Fisheries, Wildlife and Conservation Sciences, 

Oregon State University 

 Project title: Developing multi-method approaches for landscape-scale sampling of small mammals 

 Summary: The Twining Applied Quantitative Ecology Lab at Oregon State University is seeking a highly motivated PhD student to conduct applied ecological research focused on developing field and statistical methods for statewide monitoring of small mammal populations. 
 Position description: Small mammal populations are critical to Oregon’s ecosystems, with essential roles in the regulation of plant communities, as ecosystem engineers, and as a critical prey base to many predators. Despite this, the status of most small mammal species in Oregon is uncertain. In Oregon’s State Wildlife Action Plan, several are identified as Species of Greatest Conservation Need (e.g., Western gray squirrel, red tree vole) while many others are recognized as Species of Greatest Information Need (e.g., Preble’s shrew). The most recent data we have on a state-wide scale to inform the conservation and management of small mammals in Oregon are records reported within “Land Mammals of Oregon” (Verts & Carraway, 1998). The long-term goal of this project is to update estimates of i) distribution, ii) abundance, iii) and habitat associations for a range small mammals statewide. A critical step towards this goal is developing capacity for large-scale sampling of small mammals, which requires a suite of non-invasive survey tools applicable to three key groups: i) arboreal species, e.g., Western grey squirrels, red tree voles, ii) terrestrial species e.g., Preble’s shrew, and iii) fossorial species e.g., pocket gophers. Optimal multi-method protocols will be developed through field and lab tests paired with simulations. Depending on students’ interests, there will be scope to develop research focused on any or all the key species and groups. This PhD will facilitate future statewide sampling of small mammals to inform conservation action for a range of species. 
 This PhD program will involve extensive field work in western Oregon (planning, establishing, and running field trials using a combination of invasive and non-invasive methods including capturing small mammals) as well as quantitative model development. We will develop and test a suite of non-invasive sampling methods applicable to a range of small mammals and use simulations to produce optimal multi-method sampling protocols for arboreal, terrestrial, and fossorial mammals in Oregon. The student will join a growing and supportive lab group and work closely with project partners including state agency collaborators at Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, Oregon Biodiversity Information Center, and NCASI. The student will be expected to integrate as an active collaborator and facilitate project management. They will co-develop and implement a project-related dissertation under the mentorship of their advisor, Dr. Joshua P. Twining.  
 

 
Start date: January 5th, 2026
 
 

Funding: Fully funded, including 12 months of salary (~$30-33k) and covering the costs of tuition, fees, and benefits each year. The student will be supported through a combination of graduate research assistantships and employment as a graduate teaching assistant. 
 Minimum requirements:  
•      Applicants must meet the OSU Graduate School minimum requirements for admission (found at: https://gradschool.oregonstate.edu/admissions/academic-requirements).  
•      BS in Ecology or an associated field by the expected start date. E.g., wildlife, conservation, biology, or allied fields. 
•      Strong quantitative base (e.g., statistical training, competency in R)  
•      Aptitude and enthusiasm for fieldwork under variety of conditions 
•      Strong written and oral communication skills across different types of audiences.  
•      Resilience and adaptability 
•      Ability to work both independently and collaboratively as part of a team 
 

Preferred skills and qualifications: 
•      MS in Ecology or an associated field by the expected start date. E.g., wildlife, conservation, biology, or allied fields  
•      Demonstration of an ability to take projects from planning and implementation through to completion with written products (e.g., peer reviewed publications). 
•      Trapping and handling mammals 
•      Familiarity with genetic methods (e.g., microsatellite analyses, sanger sequencing) 
•      Hierarchical modelling (e.g., occupancy modelling, spatial-recapture recapture) 
•      Experience with Bayesian inference and familiarity with relevant software 
 To apply: Please submit the following via email as a single PDF document: 

1.      Cover letter, less than 2-pages single-spaced (size 12 font) describing how you meet the minimum and preferred requirements for this role, your research interests and experiences, what you ultimately hope to do achieve within and after the PhD.  

2.      A current resume or curriculum vitae 

3.      Transcripts (unofficial copy is okay for review, but official needed if selected) 

4.      The names and contact information of three academic or professional references  
 Email your application packet to Dr. Joshua P. Twining, joshua.twining@oregonstate.edu with the email title “PhD Application – small mammals.” Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis, with priority given to applications received by July 15th. Please reach out with any questions.

 Position Description 

The Ortiz Lab at Cal Poly Pomona (www.cpp.edu) is looking for applicants for one Master’s position in the Biological Sciences department that will focus on our existing Urban Parrot Project. Project direction will be focused on utilizing LiDAR to determine vertical structure of urban parrot roosting habitat. Additional directions of interest include noise pollution as well as tracking released individuals to determine movement in our urban landscape. Previous topics that have been pursued include population estimates using visual and drone thermal imagery and habitat selection through remote sensing. 

About Our Research Lab 

The Ortiz Lab was established in 2020 and conducts research in urban wildlife and conservation education. Our wildlife research primarily utilizes non-invasive techniques to study our wild neighbors’ behavior, population, and habitat use in urban spaces through observational methods like surveys and camera trapping and computer software like GIS. It is important to us for our community members to gain an appreciation and awareness of wildlife and conduct work on research experiences in the classroom, K-12 teacher training, summer camp presentations and more. Each semester we aim to hold one outreach event in our community. Previous events include the Family Bird Festival and P-22 Day. Currently, we have 2 Master’s students, 8 active undergraduate researchers, and many committed volunteers to help achieve our research goals. Our mission is to promote healthy human-wildlife coexistence through engaging and inclusive education, outreach, and research opportunities in our local urban ecosystems for Cal Poly Pomona students and the community.

Description
The Palmquist Lab at Marshall University is recruiting for a funded MS position at Marshall University in climate change and fire effects on coastal vegetation. Our research focuses on quantifying vegetation dynamics over space and time and identifying how the relative importance of ecological processes structuring plant communities changes with spatial and temporal scale. In addition, a key goal of our research is to understand how pattern and process in plant communities will be altered in the face of global environmental change. An important motivation for our work is to address ecological questions at large spatial scales to inform landscape conservation. We collect field data, use existing large observational data sets, and implement simulation modeling to address these goals in temperate shrublands, wetlands, woodlands, and forests. Additional information about the lab can be found at http://www.kylepalmquist.org/.
 RESEARCH FOCUS: The successful candidate will explore the interacting effects of sea-level rise and increased storm surge on coastal vegetation and the effects of prescribed fire on pine-dominated vegetation on Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island (MCRDPI), a sea-island in South Carolina. Coastal vegetation provides important ecosystem services, including storm protection, erosion control, and habitat for wildlife. These complex, highly zoned plant communities are structured by multiple environmental factors including salinity, elevation, soil texture, soil moisture, exposure, and light availability. Sea-level rise and intensification of the hydrologic cycle (i.e. more frequent and intense storms) is expected to affect the distribution and composition of coastal vegetation in the future, with important implications. Prescribed fire has been implemented in pine woodlands and forests on the island to enhance their resilience to climate change and to restore their structure from closed forests to open woodlands. The effects of prescribed fire have yet to be assessed. The project will integrate remote sensing, plant community sampling, and modeling to quantify how sea-level rise and associated factors have impacted coastal vegetation up to present and how climate change may influence vegetation in the future. An additional goal is to assess how prescribed fire is influencing pine-dominated vegetation on the island by installing and re-sampling permanent vegetation plots.   
 PREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS: A background, including relevant course work, in botany or plant ecology, and GIS or remote sensing, strong communication skills, and strong quantitative skills. Experience in remote sensing and GIS and knowledge of the southeastern US flora is highly desirable.
 EXPECTATIONS: The successful candidate will be expected to conduct high-quality research, serve as a teaching assistant within the Department of Biological Sciences, present their research to the scientific community at regional and national meetings, and publish in peer-reviewed scientific journals.
 TIMELINE: The position is available starting January 2026 and possibly before.
 FUNDING: Funding will consist of a combination of research and teaching assistantships for two years. A 12-month competitive stipend ($20,000), and full tuition waiver will be provided. The student is responsible for covering University fees.
 HOW TO APPLY: Interested students should apply by submitting the following to Dr. Kyle Palmquist (palmquist@marshall.edu): 1) short statement of research interests and career goals (no longer than 1 page), 2) CV, 3) unofficial transcripts, and 4) contact information for three professional references. Please include: “MS position – coastal vegetation” and your name in the email subject.
 Review of applications will begin immediately and continue until a candidate is selected. I will contact you to discuss your research interests and goals for graduate school if I determine you would be a good fit for the lab. If selected, a full application must be submitted to the Department of Biological Sciences at Marshall University, Huntington, WV. Faculty in the Department of Biological Sciences have expertise in a variety of biological fields, including but not limited to ecology, evolution, herpetology, and physiology. More information about the Department and its programs can be found here: https://www.marshall.edu/biology/. Application requirements for admission to the DBS graduate program can be found here: https://www.marshall.edu/biology/admission/.
 Marshall University is located in Huntington, an affordable college town located on the Ohio River in the beautiful state of West Virginia. The town is small enough to get around on foot and bike, but large enough to support a variety of restaurants and other cultural activities. Huntington and the surrounding area offer ample recreational opportunities (hiking, skiing, rafting), along with proximity to larger cities, including Louisville, KY, Cincinnati, OH, and Columbus, OH. In the Palmquist Lab, we highly value and encourage work-life balance. 
 I strongly encourage students from diverse backgrounds and experiences to apply. Feel free to contact me with questions at any time.

Description
OVERVIEW:
The laboratory of Nina Overgaard Therkildsen at Cornell University is seeking a highly motivated postdoctoral to lead a project exploring the use of DNA-based methods to monitor lower food web dynamics. Quantifying zooplankton diversity and abundance is vital for monitoring ecosystem health, but traditional methods based on microscopy are labor-intensive and often provide limited taxonomic resolution. Metabarcoding offers promise of faster, cheaper, more accurate, and higher-resolution characterization of zooplankton biodiversity. However, these methods can be limited by primer biases, incomplete reference databases, and challenges in accurately reflecting organismal biomass. Shotgun metagenomics - sequencing all DNA present in a sample without the need for targeted amplification - may provide a more comprehensive and unbiased view of community composition. This approach has the potential to offer a more accurate estimate of relative abundance, but its performance and practicality for application on complex real-world tissue mixtures has not yet been validated. Accordingly, both metabarcoding and metagenomic approaches will need careful context-specific evaluation and benchmarking against traditional approaches prior to any large-scale implementation in monitoring programs. This position offers the exciting opportunity to assess the performance of these emerging techniques in a real-world monitoring program and help shape the future of aquatic ecosystem assessment.
 KEY RESPONSIBILITIES:
The project will generate side-by-side comparisons of results from metabarcoding, metagenomics, and traditional microscopy on samples collected by the Hudson River Lower Food Web Monitoring Program. The postdoc is expected to lead efforts in the following five areas:
·      Design and refine experimental and laboratory protocols for DNA extraction and library preparation from bulk tissue and water samples
·      Analyze high-throughput sequencing data and optimize bioinformatic pipelines for both metabarcoding and metagenomic workflows
·      Build and curate taxonomic reference databases from public repositories and de novo sequencing
·      Collaborate with partners and regional stakeholders and co-organize annual workshops to promote knowledge exchange
·      Prepare peer-reviewed publications and presentations for both scientific and broader audiences
 DESIRED QUALIFICATIONS:
·      A Ph.D. in molecular ecology, bioinformatics, evolutionary biology, environmental genomics, or a related field
·      Demonstrated experience with metabarcoding, metagenomics, or other environmental DNA applications
·      Proficiency in programming and bioinformatics tools for high-throughput sequence analysis
·      Excellent organizational skills, attention to detail, and ability to work both independently and collaboratively in a team environment.
·      Strong written and verbal communication skills
·      Commitment to fostering an inclusive and supportive research environment
            TERMS OF APPOINTMENT:
This is a full-time position starting in late summer 2025 (or as soon as possible thereafter). The initial appointment is for 12 months, with the potential for renewal based on performance and available funding. The position will be based in Ithaca, NY, in the Department of Natural Resources and the Environment at Cornell University. While on-site work is preferred, we offer some flexibility. Salary will be commensurate with experience and competitive. Our lab and Cornell University are committed to fostering a diverse, equitable, and inclusive environment. We strongly encourage applications from individuals of underrepresented and marginalized backgrounds.

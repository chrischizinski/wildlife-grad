The focal project will be to sample arthropods from high-elevation sites in the Ouachita Mountains of Arkansas and Oklahoma, employ high-throughput DNA barcoding methods to uncover biodiversity patterns, and relate those patterns to environmental variables and ecosystem function.  Prospective applicants should have research interests in entomology, ecology, and evolutionary biology, and should have strong field, lab, and analytical skills.  Applicants with previous experience using molecular techniques (e.g., PCR, NGS library preparation, metabarcoding, etc.) and bioinformatics are preferred.  Experience with GIS and/or R is also desirable. \n Financial support will be provided through a combination of teaching and research assistantships.  Assistantships come with a full tuition (not fees) waiver and 67% of the student health insurance paid for by the university.  The selected applicant would need to be admitted to a Ph.D. program at the University of Arkansas for the Spring 2026 semester, which begins January 12, 2026.  Students admitted to a Ph.D. program may also be eligible for a U of A Doctoral Fellowship that adds to their assistantship stipend for 4 years.  More information about these fellowships can be found at: https://graduate-students.uark.edu/cost-and-funding/index.php.  Note that applications for these fellowships require the GRE General Test even if it is not required for admission to a graduate program.  Applicants who would be competitive for a doctoral fellowship will be viewed favorably.  Continued support will be contingent on satisfactory performance and progress. \n Research in the Forest Ecology & Health Lab uses field experiments and naturally occurring environmental gradients to examine how biogeochemistry and nutrients impact community structure and trophic interactions among soil arthropods and ant species primarily in forest ecosystems.  This project is in collaboration with Dr. Donald Shepard in the University of Arkansas, Department of Biological Sciences, and Dr. Ashley Dowling in the University of Arkansas, Department of Entomology and Plant Pathology.  More information about their research and labs can be found at: https://shepardlab.wixsite.com/home and https://adowling.hosted.uark.edu/index.html.  Information about the Ph.D. in Entomology program and its requirements is provided here: https://enpl.uark.edu/programs/phd-program.php. Depending on their interests and goals, the selected applicant may have the option to apply through the Ph.D. in Biology program: https://biology.uark.edu/academics/graduate/index.php. \n To apply, send an email to Dr. Natalie Clay (nclay@uark.edu) that includes as attachments: 1) a cover letter expressing your interest and highlighting your qualifications for the position as well as your future career goals, 2) your curriculum vitae, 3) an unofficial copy of your college transcripts, and 4) names and contact information for three professional references.  To receive full consideration, submit your application by August 1, 2025; however, applications will be considered until the position is filled.  Note: the selected applicant will still need to apply to and be accepted into a Ph.D. program at the University of Arkansas.  The application deadline for Spring 2026 admission is September 1 for Entomology and October 1 for Biology.  Please email Dr. Clay (nclay@uark.edu) with any questions or concerns about the project/position.  \n Natalie A.

MS Concentrations include Conservation Biology, Environmental Education, Advocacy for Social Justice and Sustainability, and several others. In Conservation Biology, students focus on gaining quantitative (GIS and statistics), writing, and ecological field skills. Students also gain experience with community engagement, social justice, and applied research and service.\n\nStudents often work with Antioch faculty in our existing research programs. Specifically in our Conservation Biology concentration, we have expertise in vertebrate ecology (e.g., birds, snakes), invertebrate ecology (e.g., estuarine invertebrates, insects), tropical ecology, forest ecology, alpine ecology, marine ecology, and coastal restoration. In some cases, faculty may have extramural funding to support students in seasonal field and lab positions, including research in New England and in the Caribbean. Students who are eligible for US federal work-study can work part time in various on-campus work-study positions, including Graduate Teaching and Research Assistantships and various positions in our numerous campus centers (e.g., Institute for International Conservation, Spatial Analysis Lab). However, you need to be accepted and taking classes as a graduate student to be eligible for these work-study positions. Students at Antioch generally pay for at least part of their own tuition, but we offer numerous university-wide grants and scholarships, which can help defray tuition costs, and which are detailed here: https://www.antioch.edu/admission-aid/financial-aid/scholarships-and-grants/ . We also work with students to help them apply for external scholarships, fellowships, and research-focused grants.\n\nStudents can earn their graduate degree with either face-to-face classes at the Antioch University New England campus in Keene, NH, USA, or fully online classes (that can be taken from anywhere) which are offered each semester, or with a mixture of the two. Ecological field trip classes (intensive 1-2 week trips to destinations abroad and in-country) are also available for all students. All classes are just 1-2 days a week, making this a viable program for environmental professionals working part or full-time. Our programs are student-centered, flexible, and tailored to meet your individual needs, learning style, and location.\n\nJoin our tight-knit community as we strive to advance social and environmental justice, conserve biodiversity, and mitigate climate change as a department and as a university!

Kennedy Waterfowl and Wetlands Conservation Center at Clemson University is seeking a highly motivated Ph.D. or M.S. candidate to conduct research on materials for tidal trunks and other water control structures with the goal of developing alternative, cost-effective solutions for water level management in waterfowl impoundments in coastal South Carolina. \n Water control structures are critical for effective wetland management. Historically, wooden tidal trunks had a life span of 25–30 years, but the discontinuation of chromate copper arsenate and creosote-treated lumber has reduced this to 8–10 years due to the use of pressure-treated lumber with alkaline copper quaternary preservatives. These trunks lose tensile strength from cyclic wetting and drying, salt crystal formation, decomposition, and insect colonization, with replacement costs reaching $20,000 to $25,000 each. Research is required to evaluate new materials and designs for tidal trunks while considering traditional design significance. The objectives of this study are to 1) inventory the number and characteristics of tidal trunks and other water control structures in South Carolina's coastal counties, 2) interview land managers and owners to evaluate critical and desirable design features of tidal trunks, 3) conduct a comprehensive literature review evaluating potential materials and designs, 4) document wildlife and invertebrate use of tidal trunks, 5) evaluate material performance, and 6) work with experienced tidal trunk builders to design, build, and install new prototypes.  \n The student will be working toward a graduate degree in Forest Resources, Biosystems Engineering, Environmental Engineering and Earth Sciences, or Civil Engineering at Clemson University. Clemson University (http://www.clemson.edu/about/) is a public land-grant Carnegie R1 Research University in a college town atmosphere on Lake Hartwell within view of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Students will take classes on the main campus and conduct fieldwork along South Carolina's coast at the Tom Yawkey Wildlife Center, the Baruch Institute of Coastal Ecology and Forest Science, located on the 16,000-acre Hobcaw Barony property, and other coastal locations. \n The student will be advised by a multidisciplinary team comprised of Dr. Christophe Darnault (Environmental Engineering and Earth Sciences), Dr. Brunela Rodrigues (Wood Utilization and Biomaterials), Dr. Michael Stoner (Civil Engineering), and Dr. Jim Anderson (James C. Kennedy Waterfowl and Wetlands Conservation Center).  \n\nQUALIFICATIONS: B.S. (for M.S.) and M.S. (for Ph.D.) in Environmental or Civil Engineering, Materials Science, Wood Science, Forest Engineering, Environmental Science, or a closely related field. Minimum undergraduate GPA of 3.00. A strong interest and experience in engineering design, material science, and design software is crucial. Interest in environmental sustainability, historic preservation, wetlands, statistics, and publishing is a plus. A valid driver’s license and reliable transportation is required. Due to current visa restrictions imposed by the United States government, you must be a United States citizen to apply for this position. \n Clemson University does not discriminate based on race, color, religion, sexual orientation, gender, pregnancy, national origin, age, or disability. We encourage applications from minorities, women, veterans, and all other qualified applicants. \n STIPEND: $25,000 (Ph.D.) or $22,000 (M.S.) plus tuition waiver. \n CONTACT: Interested individuals should email a letter of interest, resume, a <1,000-word statement of purpose (why do you want to work on this project, your research interests, and long-term career goals), unofficial copy of transcripts, GRE/TOEFL scores (if available), proof of valid drivers license, examples of published papers, and contact information for 3 references to Ms. Crystal Anderson at crhode2@clemson.edu. \nContact\nCrystal Anderson\n8646342170\ncrhode2@clemson.edu (preferred contact method)",

Despite this, the status of most small mammal species in Oregon is uncertain. In Oregon’s State Wildlife Action Plan, several are identified as Species of Greatest Conservation Need (e.g., Western gray squirrel, red tree vole) while many others are recognized as Species of Greatest Information Need (e.g., Preble’s shrew). The most recent data we have on a state-wide scale to inform the conservation and management of small mammals in Oregon are records reported within “Land Mammals of Oregon” (Verts & Carraway, 1998). The long-term goal of this project is to update estimates of i) distribution, ii) abundance, iii) and habitat associations for a range small mammals statewide. A critical step towards this goal is developing capacity for large-scale sampling of small mammals, which requires a suite of non-invasive survey tools applicable to three key groups: i) arboreal species, e.g., Western grey squirrels, red tree voles, ii) terrestrial species e.g., Preble’s shrew, and iii) fossorial species e.g., pocket gophers. Optimal multi-method protocols will be developed through field and lab tests paired with simulations. Depending on students’ interests, there will be scope to develop research focused on any or all the key species and groups. This PhD will facilitate future statewide sampling of small mammals to inform conservation action for a range of species. \n This PhD program will involve extensive field work in western Oregon (planning, establishing, and running field trials using a combination of invasive and non-invasive methods including capturing small mammals) as well as quantitative model development. We will develop and test a suite of non-invasive sampling methods applicable to a range of small mammals and use simulations to produce optimal multi-method sampling protocols for arboreal, terrestrial, and fossorial mammals in Oregon. The student will join a growing and supportive lab group and work closely with project partners including state agency collaborators at Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, Oregon Biodiversity Information Center, and NCASI. The student will be expected to integrate as an active collaborator and facilitate project management. They will co-develop and implement a project-related dissertation under the mentorship of their advisor, Dr. Joshua P. Twining.  \n \n\n \nStart date: January 5th, 2026\n \n \n\nFunding: Fully funded, including 12 months of salary (~$30-33k) and covering the costs of tuition, fees, and benefits each year. The student will be supported through a combination of graduate research assistantships and employment as a graduate teaching assistant. \n Minimum requirements:  \n•      Applicants must meet the OSU Graduate School minimum requirements for admission (found at: https://gradschool.oregonstate.edu/admissions/academic-requirements).  \n•      BS in Ecology or an associated field by the expected start date. E.g., wildlife, conservation, biology, or allied fields. \n•      Strong quantitative base (e.g., statistical training, competency in R)  \n•      Aptitude and enthusiasm for fieldwork under variety of conditions \n•      Strong written and oral communication skills across different types of audiences.  \n•      Resilience and adaptability \n•      Ability to work both independently and collaboratively as part of a team \n \n\nPreferred skills and qualifications: \n•      MS in Ecology or an associated field by the expected start date. E.g., wildlife, conservation, biology, or allied fields  \n•      Demonstration of an ability to take projects from planning and implementation through to completion with written products (e.g., peer reviewed publications). \n•      Trapping and handling mammals \n•      Familiarity with genetic methods (e.g., microsatellite analyses, sanger sequencing) \n•      Hierarchical modelling (e.g., occupancy modelling, spatial-recapture recapture) \n•      Experience with Bayesian inference and familiarity with relevant software \n To apply: Please submit the following via email as a single PDF document: \n\n1.      Cover letter, less than 2-pages single-spaced (size 12 font) describing how you meet the minimum and preferred requirements for this role, your research interests and experiences, what you ultimately hope to do achieve within and after the PhD.  \n\n2.      A current resume or curriculum vitae \n\n3.      Transcripts (unofficial copy is okay for review, but official needed if selected) \n\n4.      The names and contact information of three academic or professional references  \n Email your application packet to Dr. Joshua P. Twining, joshua.twining@oregonstate.edu with the email title “PhD Application – small mammals.” Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis, with priority given to applications received by July 15th.

This course will provide you with the tools to be able to allow for both types of uncertainty. Model averaging involves estimating the parameters in a way that allows for model uncertainty, and it often provides better estimates and confidence/credible intervals than those from a single best model. The course is divided into two modules (Bayesian and Frequentist model averaging) composed of pre-recorded lecture material and hands-on exercises using R. The course is based on David Fletcher's recent book (Springer 2018), which can be found here.\n This is a 1-credit equivalent academic course (16 contact hrs + additional work) where you learn at your own pace over 3 months.\n DATES\nCourse materials are available for 3 months: June 2 - August 24, 2025\n COST\nPrice starts at $450 for professionals; students start at $350.\n\n16 Continuing Education Credits included for FREE\n\nLEARN MORE & REGISTER\nhttps://www.centerforwildlifestudies.org/courses/p/model-averaging-ecology\n\nClick HERE to learn more about our multi-option Professional Certification Program. \n  CWS also offers a professional certificate in Applied Quantitative Ecology.\n All courses in this program are graduate level and are designed for full-time researchers, graduate students, environmental consultants, conservation specialists, and resource management practitioners.

Good design leads to effective use of research money, time and effort, whereas poor design can lead to a study of little use, and hence a waste of these resources. Sampling techniques are useful when planning an observational study, such as a survey, whereas experimental design techniques are of use when planning an experiment. In the sampling modules, we will cover random vs. systematic sampling, stratification, hierarchical sampling, use of covariates, trend analysis, and introduce specialized techniques such as capture-mark-recapture and distance sampling. In the experimental design modules, you will learn about randomization, replication and pseudo-replication, controls, blocking, use of covariates, factorial treatments, before-after control-impact (BACI) designs, and trend analysis. In both sections of the course, we will show you how to perform power/precision analysis in order to assess what sample sizes might be required for the study to provide useful information.\nThis is a 1-credit equivalent academic course (16 contact hrs + additional work) where you learn at your own pace over 3 months.\n DATES\nCourse materials are available for 3 months: June 2 - August 24, 2025\n COST\nPrice starts at $450 for professionals; students start at $350.\n\n16 Continuing Education Credits included for FREE\n\nLEARN MORE & REGISTER\nhttps://www.centerforwildlifestudies.org/courses/p/research-design\n\nClick HERE to learn more about our multi-option Professional Certification Program. \n \nCWS also offers a professional certificate in Applied Quantitative Ecology.\n\nAll courses in this program are graduate level and are designed for full-time researchers, graduate students, environmental consultants, conservation specialists, and resource management practitioners.

The Bayesian approach involves specifying the “prior” distribution, which represents the uncertainty about the model parameters before we collect the data, and the likelihood, which represents the plausibility of different parameters values based solely on the data. These are combined via Bayes’ Rule to obtain the “posterior” distribution for the parameters, which represents the uncertainty about the parameters after we have analyzed the data. Using the Bayesian approach gives you more flexibility in the type of models that you can fit, compared to the classical frequentist approach, as the model is typically specified in the same way that you would write it down mathematically. Once you have become familiar with fitting a Bayesian model in R, you will appreciate the extra flexibility and the more intuitive way in which the results can be presented.\n This is a 1-credit equivalent academic course (16 contact hrs + additional work) where you learn at your own pace over 3 months.\n DATES\nCourse materials are available for 3 months: June 2 - August 24, 2025\n COST\nPrice starts at $450 for professionals; students start at $350.\n\n16 Continuing Education Credits included for FREE\n\nLEARN MORE & REGISTER\nhttps://www.centerforwildlifestudies.org/courses/p/bayesian-statistics\n\nClick HERE to learn more about our multi-option Professional Certification Program. \n \nCWS also offers a professional certificate in Applied Quantitative Ecology.\n All courses in this program are graduate level and are designed for full-time researchers, graduate students, environmental consultants, conservation specialists, and resource management practitioners.

Yet these services have been vastly undervalued and under-resourced. Studies estimate a US$900 billion gap in annual funding needed for conservation critical to maintaining biodiversity and climate outcomes. The field of conservation finance aims to address this massive financing gap as well as the multitude of ways global markets and policies shortchange nature. Conservation finance umbrellas a variety of concepts, including (but not limited to) payments for ecosystem services, nature-based solutions, and environmental markets. In this course, we will focus on key concepts, tools, and challenges in this space. The course will be multidisciplinary, much like the field itself, which reaches across the intersections of ecology, economics, policy, finance, and human rights. \n\nThis is a 1-credit equivalent academic course (16 contact hrs + additional work) where you learn at your own pace over 3 months.\n \nDATES\nCourse materials are available for 3 months: 07 July – 09 September 2025 \n\nCOST\nEarly bird ends June 7th - save $75!\nPrice starts at $525 for professionals; students start at $425.\n\n16 Continuing Education Credits included for FREE\n\nLEARN MORE & REGISTER\nhttps://www.centerforwildlifestudies.org/courses/p/us-wildlife-policy\n\nCWS also offers a professional certificate in Applied Quantitative Ecology.\n\nAll courses in this program are graduate level and are designed for full-time researchers, graduate students, environmental consultants, conservation specialists, and resource management practitioners.

Project direction will be focused on utilizing LiDAR to determine vertical structure of urban parrot roosting habitat. Additional directions of interest include noise pollution as well as tracking released individuals to determine movement in our urban landscape. Previous topics that have been pursued include population estimates using visual and drone thermal imagery and habitat selection through remote sensing. \n\nAbout Our Research Lab \n\nThe Ortiz Lab was established in 2020 and conducts research in urban wildlife and conservation education. Our wildlife research primarily utilizes non-invasive techniques to study our wild neighbors’ behavior, population, and habitat use in urban spaces through observational methods like surveys and camera trapping and computer software like GIS. It is important to us for our community members to gain an appreciation and awareness of wildlife and conduct work on research experiences in the classroom, K-12 teacher training, summer camp presentations and more. Each semester we aim to hold one outreach event in our community. Previous events include the Family Bird Festival and P-22 Day. Currently, we have 2 Master’s students, 8 active undergraduate researchers, and many committed volunteers to help achieve our research goals. Our mission is to promote healthy human-wildlife coexistence through engaging and inclusive education, outreach, and research opportunities in our local urban ecosystems for Cal Poly Pomona students and the community.  More information about our lab including our ongoing projects and our team can be found at www.janelortiz.com or ortizlab_cpp on Instagram. \n\nDesired Qualifications \n\nBy the start date, candidates must hold a Bachelor’s degree in Biology or related major. Prior experience with GIS and drones is preferred but not required. The candidate must be an effective leader and able to work well with others as this is a large project that will require the assistance of undergraduate researchers, communication with community members, and detailed scheduling. The ability to conduct field work in urban spaces, standing and sitting for extended periods of time, and looking upwards for a period of time will be required. Excellent communication with advisor, committee, research team, and community partners, time-management skills, a strong work ethic, and attention to detail are also essential. The candidate must also have a valid driver’s license or be able to obtain a valid driver’s license immediately upon starting in order to drive to field sites. Use of a reliable vehicle is required for field work. The candidate must also have a drone license or be able to obtain one soon after starting the position. \n\nCompensation \n\nTeaching assistantship (for at least 2 years), part-time hourly ($20/hr in 1st year), plus other supplements such as a grading position or graduate assistantship which are selective and based upon availability. Work study may also be applied depending on your financial aid package and availability. Grants and fellowship opportunities do come up and will be pursued to help supplement financial support. \n\nDeadline \n\nReview of applications will begin immediately and will continue until the position is filled. All inquiries can be sent to Dr. Janel Ortiz (jortiz@cpp.edu).

Among the most popular and diverse approaches to estimating such parameters includes a suite of sampling and analytical methods known as capture-mark-recapture (mark-recap or several similar terms). This class will focus on providing a solid foundation for using these techniques for a broad range of objectives. We emphasize asking good questions, identifying appropriate sampling methods rooted in animal behavior and ecology, and choosing the right analytical techniques in both MARK and RMark. We will show how simulations can be used to improve study design and discuss their limitations. For many of the exercises in this course, we will focus on analyzing data from large-scale grizzly bear projects co-led by Dr. Stetz. Focusing on this case study will help practitioners see more clearly how the elements of a study (background, objectives, field methods, analyses, and modeling assumptions) interact, and how this leads to better study design and execution.\n This is a 1-credit equivalent academic course (16 contact hrs + additional work) where you learn at your own pace over 3 months.\n DATES\nCourse materials are available for 3 months: June 2 - August 24, 2025\n COST\nPrice starts at $450 for professionals; students start at $350.\n\n16 Continuing Education Credits included for FREE\n\nLEARN MORE & REGISTER\nhttps://www.centerforwildlifestudies.org/courses/p/capture-mark-recapture\n\nClick HERE to learn more about our multi-option Professional Certification Program. \n \nCWS also offers a professional certificate in Applied Quantitative Ecology.\n All courses in this program are graduate level and are designed for full-time researchers, graduate students, environmental consultants, conservation specialists, and resource management practitioners.

This method is based on the simple premise that animals on or near the sampling point/line transect are more likely to be detected than animals further away. This method can be implemented on unmarked animals during a single site visit, which can be appealing compared to other approaches that require marked animals or multiple site visits (i.e., temporal replicates). Users can, however, incorporate marked animals and/or collect data with temporal replication to address questions about availability, seasonal change, and annual trends. Distance sampling can be implemented on the ground (e.g., foot, vehicle), by air (e.g., airplane, helicopter), and by water (e.g., ship, raft), and therefore useful in terrestrial, aquatic, and marine ecosystems. This course will provide a foundation in distance sampling with numerous examples of their use. Students will gain practical experience in distance sampling, including study design, data collection, data management, and analytical techniques. Analyses will be conducted in R using the unmarked package. Students will be able to implement these models, interpret their output, and summarize the results.\n This is a 1-credit equivalent academic course (16 contact hrs + additional work) where you learn at your own pace over 3 months.\n DATES\nCourse materials are available for 3 months: June 2 - August 24, 2025\n COST\nPrice starts at $450 for professionals; students start at $350.\n\n16 Continuing Education Credits included for FREE\n\nLEARN MORE & REGISTER\nhttps://www.centerforwildlifestudies.org/courses/p/distance-sampling\n\nClick HERE to learn more about our multi-option Professional Certification Program. \n \nCWS also offers a professional certificate in Applied Quantitative Ecology.\n All courses in this program are graduate level and are designed for full-time researchers, graduate students, environmental consultants, conservation specialists, and resource management practitioners.

A BCN refers to a probabilistic graphical model, specifically a Bayesian network (also called Bayesian Belief Network), designed to represent causal relationships between multiple variables in complex systems. BCN modeling is advantageous when dealing with many interconnected variables (multivariate) where direct cause-and-effect relationships might not be readily apparent; it allows for the analysis of how changes in one variable can influence others within the system, taking into account uncertainties and dependencies between variables. The initial model can be useful to determine leverage points for interventions. Due to the stability of most complex systems, the model can also predict possible outcomes based on changes to the variables or their intensity when testing interventions. \n\nThis course will walk you through the development of multiple stages of BCN modeling, including a decision net (which optimizes decisions) and an influence net. Additionally, simple BCN will be created in the third module and added to in the final module, resulting in a more complex aggregate model. This process will enable you to predict, monitor, and update your model indefinitely. You will become proficient in using the software Netica, and the modeling process used in Netica is applicable to most Bayesian network software currently available.\n\nThis is a 1-credit equivalent academic course (16 contact hrs + additional work) where you learn at your own pace over 3 months.\n DATES\n02 June – 24 August, 2025\n\nCOST\nInstructor support options start at $525 professional / $425 student\n\nLEARN MORE & REGISTER\nhttps://www.centerforwildlifestudies.org/courses/p/bayesian-causal-network-modeling \n\nCWS also offers a professional certificate in Applied Quantitative Ecology.\n\nAll courses in this program are graduate level and are designed for full-time researchers, graduate students, environmental consultants, conservation specialists, and resource management practitioners.

Much of the course is concerned with fitting generalized linear models (GLMs), as these are a basic requirement for modern quantitative ecology and wildlife management. We cover Poisson and binomial models in detail, and extensions of these when the data are overdispersed and/or zero-inflated. We also cover the use of generalized additive models (GAMs) to fit flexible, non-linear curves to model the relationship between a response variable and a numerical predictor, such as distance or depth. We discuss model-checking and residual diagnostics, to see how well our model fits the data, and model comparison using AIC in order to see which terms should be included. Repeated measurements data, in which the response variable is measured at several points in time, are also considered in detail.

Yet these services have been vastly undervalued and under-resourced. Studies estimate a US$900 billion gap in annual funding needed for conservation critical to maintaining biodiversity and climate outcomes. The field of conservation finance aims to address this massive financing gap as well as the multitude of ways global markets and policies shortchange nature. Conservation finance umbrellas a variety of concepts, including (but not limited to) payments for ecosystem services, nature-based solutions, and environmental markets. In this course, we will focus on key concepts, tools, and challenges in this space. The course will be multidisciplinary, much like the field itself, which reaches across the intersections of ecology, economics, policy, finance, and human rights.\n\nKEY QUESTIONS\nWhat is conservation finance and what is its role in biodiversity, water, and climate?\nWhat are the range of existing finance strategies and tools?\nWhat bottlenecks hold back conservation finance?\nWhat are examples of conservation finance in the field?\nHow does policy drive or shape or omit conservation finance?\nWhat are the different roles of public and private financing?\n\nThis is a 1-credit equivalent academic course (16 contact hrs + additional work) where you learn at your own pace over 3 months.\n \nDATES\nCourse materials are available for 3 months: 07 July – 08 October 2025\nLive meetings (also recorded) July 9-Aug 20 on Wednesday at 12:00-1:30pm ET\n\nCOST\nEarly bird ends June 8th - save $75!\nPrice starts at $525 for professionals; students start at $425.\n\n16 Continuing Education Credit: included for FREE\n \n LEARN MORE & REGISTER\nhttps://www.centerforwildlifestudies.org/courses/p/conservation-finance\n\nCWS also offers a professional certificate in Applied Quantitative Ecology.\n\nAll courses in this program are graduate level and are designed for full-time researchers, graduate students, environmental consultants, conservation specialists, and resource management practitioners.

This opportunity is remote.\n\nAt the heart of the USDA Forest Service's mission is their purpose. Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency’s mission and motivates their work across the agency. It’s been there from the agency’s very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the USDA Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.\n\nResearch Project: This research fellowship will use long-term (2002-2019) experimental data from the Goosenest Adaptive Management Area, a study of fuels reduction and forest restoration alternatives for managing east-side ponderosa pine/mixed-conifer forests. The treatments included group selection management to promote structural complexity, making them a useful test of different modeling approaches in the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS). Currently FVS users, which largely consist of federal land managers, have a few different way of modeling complex restoration treatments in the software. However there is not much guidance on which is most accurate, or how examples of calibrating the model to improve its performance This project will A) help calibrate the FVS growth and mortality models and b) advance the modeling of complex treatments to save agencies time and money.\n\nThe research fellow's main focus will be performing the FVS runs to compare observed vs. predicted values the 20 year span of the experiment. The fellow would contribute to completing a manuscript in preparation, have a chance to interact with regional land managers to share results, and pursue original research with this dataset. Possible independent research projects include quantifying the biomass benefits of proactive forest management, and quantifying how treatments improved outcomes after the 2021 Antelope Fire which burned over this study. Data are already proofed and formatted with a draft FVS workflow, preparing the fellow for success.\n\nThe fellowship would run from June-September 2025. Fellows are not U.S. government employees but instead paid interns through the Oak Ridge of Science and Engineering hosted by the USDA-FS. Due to the short tenure of the fellowship, remote participation is accepted but depending on location the selected candidate may opt for office space in Placerville, Vallejo, Redding, Riverside, or Arcata, California.\n\nLearning Objectives: \n\nImprove knowledge of issues and science surrounding forest restoration and hazardous fuels reduction\nAdvance skills for modeling silvicultural treatments in industry-standard software\nLearn how to communicate the benefits of active forest management in terms of ecosystem services\nGain advanced data analysis skills in linear modeling and visualization\nExperience collaborating as a key member of a research project team\nLearn about science leadership by pursuing original research\nMentor: The mentor for this opportunity is Christopher Looney (christopher.looney@usda.gov).

The project focuses on how spatial behavior and population demography are influenced by pre-commercial thinning treatments. Pay is $20.45/hour, 40 hours per week. Successful applicants will start on 1 Aug 2025 (at the earliest) and work through 31 Oct 2025.  \n\nThe technicians will work both independently and as crew members with other WDNR and WSU personnel and will collect data in the field involving a combination of live trapping, hare handling/processing, VHF radio telemetry, and investigating hare mortalities. In addition, there will be many opportunities to assist with camera trap deployment, vegetation sampling, and fecal pellet counts. Competitive applicants will be comfortable navigating and hauling bulky live traps through dense regenerating forests and recently thinned stands covered in slash on uneven terrain. \n\nThe project field sites are located in a cold-temperate montane forest environment where the weather is unpredictable both daily and seasonally.

Thus, we expect that competitive applicants will have substantial field experience in all types of environments and weather conditions. \n\nTechnicians must be able to maintain a positive outlook during difficult field conditions and work effectively with a cohesive team, including a PhD student and other seasonal technicians. Shared housing is provided by WSU at an apartment in nearby Tonasket, WA (~20-minute drive from the state forest) but camping in the state forest for short periods is possible. The technician can expect to work upwards of 12 hours on busy days, with a typical schedule of Monday through Friday. \n Required Qualifications and Skills:\n ·        Eagerness to work outdoors in often harsh field conditions (e.g., heat, rain, biting insects)\n·        Flexibility to work varying day lengths and adjust to changing schedules and weather\n·        Ability to carry up to 50 lbs over rough terrain and hike up to 10 miles per day\n·        Strong interpersonal skills and a positive attitude towards difficult field work\n·        Valid driver's license\n·        Undergraduate degree in wildlife ecology, natural resources, biology, environmental science, or a related field \n·        Navigation skills (Avenza, handheld GPS, compass)\n·        Comfortable driving four-wheel drive trucks safely on unmaintained forest roads\n Preferred Qualifications:\n ·        Substantial experience with VHF telemetry and field mortality investigations\n·        Experience trapping and handling wild animals (especially small mammals)\n To Apply:\n Send a cover letter, CV, and contact information for three references in a single .pdf document to Nate Hooven (nathan.hooven@wsu.edu) with the subject line “Snowshoe hare technician position”.

Terminal barrier removal in the Great Lakes region requires considering tradeoffs for native fish passage, needs for increased sea lamprey control, and passage of other potentially undesirable species (e.g., Pacific salmonids). Therefore, decision makers need a modeling framework to enable them to understand potential changes in fish production as novel habitats are opened through barrier removal or remediation. The hired associate will work closely with a technical working group comprised of a mixture of highly-engaged federal, state, and university biologists to identify case study streams in collaboration with local rightsholders, NGOs, and stakeholders, update an existing individual-based model to expand its utility from one stream to many and incorporate the effects of ecosystem change into fish production projections, and help devise a framework for development of a basin-wide decision support tool to predict fish production under different levels of fish passage. Additional responsibilities include presenting research to partners, technical committees, and at scientific conferences, as well as preparing manuscripts and reports. The hired associate will be part of the Georgia Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit, located at the University of Georgia, in Athens, GA; working from a remote location may be possible. Other related duties may also be assigned as needs arise (e.g., required training, contribution to general operation of the research unit). Further, lab members are expected to help maintain a supportive collegiate environment. Candidate would ideally start in Summer 2025.\n\nQualified candidates will have a PhD in fisheries science, wildlife science, or related discipline with a strong quantitative background and record of research productivity in quantitative methods. Experience in individual-based modeling, fish production modeling, and structured decision making is desirable, as well as experience or desire to work with stakeholders, rightsholders, and agency personnel.\n\nAll applicants must apply through www.ugajobsearch.com. Search for posting #G/R29564P. Please include your CV, letter of interest, transcripts (unofficial), and contact information for three references.

Our research focuses on quantifying vegetation dynamics over space and time and identifying how the relative importance of ecological processes structuring plant communities changes with spatial and temporal scale. In addition, a key goal of our research is to understand how pattern and process in plant communities will be altered in the face of global environmental change. An important motivation for our work is to address ecological questions at large spatial scales to inform landscape conservation. We collect field data, use existing large observational data sets, and implement simulation modeling to address these goals in temperate shrublands, wetlands, woodlands, and forests. Additional information about the lab can be found at http://www.kylepalmquist.org/.\n RESEARCH FOCUS: The successful candidate will explore the interacting effects of sea-level rise and increased storm surge on coastal vegetation and the effects of prescribed fire on pine-dominated vegetation on Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island (MCRDPI), a sea-island in South Carolina. Coastal vegetation provides important ecosystem services, including storm protection, erosion control, and habitat for wildlife. These complex, highly zoned plant communities are structured by multiple environmental factors including salinity, elevation, soil texture, soil moisture, exposure, and light availability. Sea-level rise and intensification of the hydrologic cycle (i.e. more frequent and intense storms) is expected to affect the distribution and composition of coastal vegetation in the future, with important implications. Prescribed fire has been implemented in pine woodlands and forests on the island to enhance their resilience to climate change and to restore their structure from closed forests to open woodlands. The effects of prescribed fire have yet to be assessed. The project will integrate remote sensing, plant community sampling, and modeling to quantify how sea-level rise and associated factors have impacted coastal vegetation up to present and how climate change may influence vegetation in the future.

Our research focuses on quantifying vegetation dynamics over space and time and identifying how the relative importance of ecological processes structuring plant communities changes with spatial and temporal scale. In addition, a key goal of our research is to understand how pattern and process in plant communities will be altered in the face of global environmental change. An important motivation for our work is to address ecological questions at large spatial scales to inform landscape conservation. We collect field data, use existing large observational data sets, and implement simulation modeling to address these goals in temperate shrublands, wetlands, woodlands, and forests. Additional information about the lab can be found at http://www.kylepalmquist.org/. \n RESEARCH FOCUS: The successful candidate will broadly explore the interacting effects of climate change, wildfire, and livestock grazing intensity on big sagebrush plant communities throughout their spatial extent in the western US. These water-limited ecosystems are undergoing rapid environmental change due to multiple stressors (climate change, increases in wildfire activity, species invasions) and represent some of the most threatened systems in North America. This project is supported by a five-year NSF grant and will leverage an individual-based plant simulation model to quantify the impacts of multiple global change drivers on big sagebrush plant communities under future conditions. Potential focal projects the MS student would lead include: the role of competition in altering plant functional type responses to global change drivers and the implications for shrub-grass coexistence or leveraging livestock grazing as a tool to prevent the spread of invasive species and decrease wildfire risk under a future climate. This project will provide collaborative opportunities with ecologists at Yale University, and with scientists and managers from multiple federal agencies (BLM, USGS, USFWS, USFS, USDA ARS). \n REQUIRED QUALIFICATIONS: A background and relevant course work in ecology and statistics, knowledge and experience in sagebrush ecosystems of the western U.S., strong communication skills, and strong quantitative skills. Experience in ecological modeling and computer programming is highly desirable. An interest in learning modeling is required.\n EXPECTATIONS: The successful candidate will be expected to conduct high-quality research, serve as a teaching assistant within the Department of Biological Sciences for one year, present their research to the scientific community at regional and national meetings, and publish in peer-reviewed scientific journals.\n TIMELINE: The position is available starting August 2025 or January 2026.\n FUNDING: Funding will consist of a combination of research and teaching assistantships for two years.

    "description": "Postdoctoral Research Associate - Evaluating the impacts of multiple global change drivers on dryland plant communities - Marshall U, Palmquist lab\nMarshall University (State) | http://www.kylepalmquist.org\nDetails\nApplication Deadline:\n02/28/2026\nPublished:\n06/30/2025\nStarting Date:\nbetween 3/15/2026 and 6/1/2026\nHours per Week:\nat most 40\nSalary:\nstarting at $55,000 per year\nEducation Required:\nDoctorate\nExperience Required:\nat least 3 years\nLocation:\nMarshall University, Department of Biological Sciences (Huntington, West Virginia)\nTags:\nFaculty / Post-Doc Appointments\nDescription\nThe Palmquist Lab at Marshall University is recruiting for an NSF funded postdoctoral research associate focused on evaluating the impacts of multiple global change drivers on dryland plant communities. Our research focuses on quantifying vegetation dynamics over space and time and identifying how the relative importance of ecological processes structuring plant communities changes with spatial and temporal scale. In addition, a key goal of our research is to understand how pattern and process in plant communities will be altered in the face of global environmental change. An important motivation for our work is to address ecological questions at large spatial scales to inform landscape conservation. We collect field data, use existing large observational data sets, and implement simulation modeling to address these goals in temperate shrublands, wetlands, woodlands, and forests. Additional information about the lab can be found at http://www.kylepalmquist.org/. \n RESEARCH FOCUS: The successful candidate will broadly explore the interacting effects of climate change, wildfire, and livestock grazing intensity on big sagebrush plant communities throughout their spatial extent in the western US via ecological modeling. These water-limited ecosystems are undergoing rapid environmental change due to multiple stressors (climate change, increases in wildfire activity, species invasions) and represent some of the most threatened systems in North America. This project is supported by a five-year NSF CAREER grant and will leverage an individual-based plant simulation model (STEPWAT2) to quantify the impacts of multiple global change drivers on big sagebrush plant communities under future conditions. Potential focal projects include but are not limited to: investigating the role of competition in altering plant functional type responses to global change drivers and the implications for shrub-grass coexistence, identifying the likelihood of ecosystem state transitions under a future climate, and investigating how livestock grazing can be used as a tool to maintain native plant cover and prevent invasion by non-native species. This project will provide collaborative and networking opportunities with ecologists at Yale University, and with scientists and managers from multiple federal agencies (BLM, USGS, USFWS, USFS, USDA ARS). \n REQUIRED QUALIFICATIONS: \n·      A PhD in ecology or a related field with relevant course work in ecology and statistics and a demonstrated publication record in these fields\n·      Knowledge of and/or experience working in sagebrush ecosystems of the western U.S.\n·      Strong quantitative skills and experience in ecological modeling and computer programming in R and Unix environments\n·      Excellent organizational skills, attention to detail, and ability to work both independently and collaboratively in a team environment\n·      Strong written and verbal communication skills\n EXPECTATIONS: The successful candidate will be expected to conduct high-quality research, present their research to the scientific community at regional and national meetings, publish in peer-reviewed scientific journals, and mentor undergraduate and graduate students in collaborative settings. The candidate will have the opportunity to gain additional teaching experience in the Department of Biological Sciences, at a minimum by presenting their research via guest lectures within Palmquist’s existing ecology classes (Principles of Ecology, Plant Ecology). The candidate will also be expected to participate in educational and outreach activities with Marshall University undergraduates and the Northern Arapaho tribes in Wyoming.\n TIMELINE: The position is available starting March 2026 and must be filled no later than June 2026.\n FUNDING: Funding is available for two years and five months at $55,000 per year. Full benefits (health insurance and retirement) will be provided. Funding beyond one year will be contingent on satisfactory job performance.\n LOCATION: The position will be based at Marshall University in Huntington, WV. For the right candidate, remote work may be considered.\n Marshall University is located in Huntington, an affordable college town located on the Ohio River in the beautiful state of West Virginia. The town is small enough to get around on foot and bike, but large enough to support a variety of restaurants and other cultural activities. Huntington and the surrounding area offer ample recreational opportunities (hiking, skiing, rafting), along with proximity to larger cities, including Louisville, KY, Cincinnati, OH, and Columbus, OH. In the Palmquist Lab, we highly value and encourage work-life balance. Faculty in the Department of Biological Sciences have expertise in a variety of biological fields, including but not limited to ecology, evolution, herpetology, and physiology. More information about the Department and its programs can be found here: https://www.marshall.edu/biology/.\n HOW TO APPLY: Interested individuals should apply by submitting the following to Dr. Kyle Palmquist (palmquist@marshall.edu). Please include: “Postdoc position - dryland plant communities” and your name in the email subject.\n 1) cover letter describing research interests and career goals (no longer than 2 pages)\n2) CV\n3) unofficial transcripts\n4) up to three representative peer-reviewed publications (in press or published)\n5) contact information for three professional references\n Review of applications will begin immediately and continue until a candidate is selected.

Add to that learning a new set of skills and gaining great field experience at one of the longest-running parrot projects in the Americas? If this sounds good to you, come and join our team of dedicated volunteers!\n\nFor over two decades, we’ve been working in the lowlands of southeastern Peru, led by Drs. Brightsmith and Vigo-Trauco from Texas A&M’s Schubot Center for Avian Health. Our research focuses on the breeding ecology of wild parrots and macaws in Tambopata, a region critical to conservation since 1999.\n\nVolunteers are the backbone of our work, contributing thousands of hours to understanding these incredible birds. Whether you’re passionate about wildlife, have a background in biology, or are just eager to gain field experience, we welcome you to be part of this rewarding journey.\n\nWith various programs designed for all experience levels—from birdwatching enthusiasts to graduate-level professionals—there’s an opportunity for everyone who’s responsible, enthusiastic, and ready for an adventure in conservation. Are you ready for a hands-on conservation experience in one of the most biodiverse places on Earth? Come join us in making a real difference!\n\nWe have different volunteer assistantships programs that require different levels of experience from amateur enthusiasts and birdwatchers to graduate-level professionals. Volunteer activities vary according to the position.\n\nLONG TERM VOLUNTEER ASSISTANT\n\n Join our team and be trained to identify all local parrots by sight and sound. You’ll conduct parrot censuses in the forest and at clay licks, locate foraging parrots, and enter collected data into our system. During the macaw breeding season, you’ll learn to climb trees using rope systems and observe macaw behavior around nests. Additional duties include campsite setup and cooking. \n\nSHORT VOLUNTEER ASSISTANT\n\nIn this role, you will receive quick training to assist our field team in monitoring macaw nests from the ground, supporting the team that works with ropes. You will also be trained to monitor macaw behavior around nests and help with clay lick observations. Due to the shorter stay, involvement in activities like parrot censuses and tree climbing will be limited. Other responsibilities include campsite setup and cooking.\n\nSPONSORED LONG TERM VOLUNTEER POSITION\n\nBe part of the “Harrison's Bird Foods Internship in the Rainforest Program”! You will receive comprehensive training similar to our long-term volunteers, including parrot identification, conducting censuses, monitoring foraging behaviors, tracking tree species macaws use, and entering data. In addition to tree climbing and nest observation, you’ll also assist with macaw chick health checks, including taking biometric measurements. You’ll play a key role in our nest monitoring expeditions throughout the Tambopata River basin. As with all positions, activities include campsite setup and cooking. \n\nQUALIFICATIONS\n\nLONG-TERM VOLUNTEER ASSISTANT REQUIREMENTS:\n\nCandidates must have previous field experience and experience working with birds. A degree in Biology, Ecology, Forestry, Wildlife Sciences, or a related field, or be close to graduation, is required. \n\nAdditional Requirements: Volunteers should be in good physical condition, able to carry a 40 lb (18 kg) pack over moderate terrain for up to 2 km, and must have no fear of heights, particularly during the macaw breeding season (Dec-Mar). They should be able to work well in a team, handle stressful and challenging situations, and have travel insurance coverage\n\nSHORT-TERM VOLUNTEER ASSISTANT REQUIREMENTS \n\nApplicants should have some experience observing animals, either in the wild or in captivity, along with an appreciation for nature and wildlife. \n\nAdditional Requirements:   \nVolunteers need to be in average physical condition, capable of walking 2 km over moderate terrain. They should have strong observational skills, the ability to remain seated for long periods of time, and a basic knowledge of birds. Travel insurance coverage is also required.\n\nSPONSORED LONG TERM VOLUNTEER POSITION\n\nThis position is available immediately, with a start date of November 28, 2024. Candidates must have previous field experience and experience working with birds, along with a degree or be in the final semesters of studies in Biology, Ecology, Forestry, or a related field. Some level of Spanish proficiency is also necessary.\n\nAdditional Requirements: Volunteers must be in good physical condition, able to carry a 40 lb (18 kg) pack over moderate terrain for up to 2 km and have no fear of heights (Dec-May). They should have a positive attitude toward facing new and challenging situations, be able to work well in a team under stress and have travel insurance coverage.\n\nACCOMODATIONS\n\nOur headquarters are located in the Malinoski Biological Station which is located right where the Malinoski river joins the Tambopata River. The station is a two-story wooden house with electricity generated by a gasoline generator and 75 Gb internet. The rooms are for two people and bathrooms and showers are shared. The first floor has a large area for common use of the different teams of researchers who stay there.\n\nCOST\nEssentially, volunteering is free. We take care of research permit costs, cover the costs of all staff, work to maintain training material, and also deal with all correspondence and various aspects of project management. However, our budget does not extend to being able to pay for all aspects of volunteer participation. As such you only need to cover food, accommodation, and other services provided by the field station. The costs are very reasonable. The daily fee is according to the position and experience:\n\n• Long-term assistant: 30 USD/day \n\n• Short-term assistant: 45 USD/day \n\n• SPONSORED Long-term assistant: NO COST (Thanks to the generous sponsorship from Harrison's Bird Foods) \n\n\n*A one-time processing fee of $30 will be added for all volunteers.\nThis rate covers food (3 meals per day) and accommodations (bedding is provided). All volunteers will be charged an airport transfer to be picked up ($20) or dropped off ($10) at the airport plus an extra cost to be transported to the port in private transportation ($45). Once a volunteer was accepted, they will be sent an invoice by email from Texas A&M University. Upon receipt, the volunteer needs to pay 20% of the total cost of their stay. This non-refundable payment is required to hold the reservation for the assistant. The remaining 80% of the payment should be made at least two weeks before the assistant arrives at the release site. Arrangements can be made if assistants wish to pay in cash in the country. However, prior permission from the coordinator is needed. Changes to the daily fee may apply according to availability and season\n\n  Contact\nDr. Gabriela Vigo-Trauco\nvolunteering@themacawsociety.org (preferred contact method)",

The study will begin September 2025, run for at least three years, and is a collaboration of Brown University, the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (RIDEM), and the USDA National Genomics Center for Wildlife and Fish Conservation. \n\n\nBackground: There is a growing realization that muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus) are experiencing precipitous, widespread population decline across North America.  This unexplained phenomenon is triggering alarm among ecologists and wildlife managers.  Using kayaks, this 3-year project will collect environmental DNA (eDNA) water samples and other field observations from 300 northeastern wetlands to determine muskrat presence/absence, and combine these field data with satellite remote sensing and geospatial analysis/modeling to tackle the science question \"Why are muskrat populations declining?\" in the Northeastern USA, where steep population losses have occurred since the 1980s.  The project will test at least two leading hypotheses for muskrat population decline: 1) widespread invasion of Phragmites (common reed) into wetlands previously dominated by Typha (cattail, a preferred food and habitat for muskrat); and 2) increased variability of water levels from human regulation and/or climate change, and other hypotheses will also be considered.   \n\nSuccessful candidates will have opportunities to interact with numerous governmental wildlife management and conservation agencies, NASA, and academia.  The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (RIDEM) and USDA National Genomics Center for Wildlife and Fish Conservation are key co-funded partners.  The project has enthusiastic collaborators in State environmental management agencies with partners in 7 States already identified and 4 pending.  Successful candidates will attend annual meetings of the NASA Biodiversity and Ecological Conservation program, and the Northeast Association of Fish & Wildlife Agencies.\n\nQualifications:  We are seeking candidates enthusiastic about wildlife ecology, conservation, field work, remote sensing, and/or geospatial analysis and modeling.  Applicants for a Postdoctoral Researcher position must demonstrate a strong publication record, a Ph.D. degree in wildlife ecology, biogeography, environmental science, habitat suitability modeling/geospatial analysis/remote sensing, or related field.  Applicants for a Field Technician position must demonstrate successful previous experience organizing, planning, and executing broad-scale field seasons with numerous partners.  Examples of relevant field experience include water sampling, vegetation identification, drone mapping, hydrological measurements, and/or GNSS surveys.  Applicants should also feel comfortable navigating a kayak in the backcountry and working solo or as part of a small team. For either position, there is flexibility with respect to field vs. computational work depending on applicant pool qualifications and interests.  No experience with eDNA is required as successful applicants will receive training for eDNA water sampling from the USDA National Genomics Center for Wildlife and Fish Conservation. \n\nThe anticipated duration of the position(s) is 1-3 years. Salary will be determined by education level (Ph.D., master’s, or baccalaureate degree) and previous experience.

Add to that learning a new set of skills and gaining great field experience at one of the longest-running parrot projects in the Americas? If this sounds good to you, come and join our team of dedicated volunteers!\n\nFor over two decades, we’ve been working in the lowlands of southeastern Peru, led by Drs. Brightsmith and Vigo-Trauco from Texas A&M’s Schubot Center for Avian Health. Our research focuses on the breeding ecology of wild parrots and macaws in Tambopata, a region critical to conservation since 1999.\n\nVolunteers are the backbone of our work, contributing thousands of hours to understanding these incredible birds. Whether you’re passionate about wildlife, have a background in biology, or are just eager to gain field experience, we welcome you to be part of this rewarding journey.\n\nWith various programs designed for all experience levels—from birdwatching enthusiasts to graduate-level professionals—there’s an opportunity for everyone who’s responsible, enthusiastic, and ready for an adventure in conservation. Are you ready for a hands-on conservation experience in one of the most biodiverse places on Earth? Come join us in making a real difference!\n\nWe have different volunteer assistantships programs that require different levels of experience from amateur enthusiasts and birdwatchers to graduate-level professionals. Volunteer activities vary according to the position.\n\nLONG TERM VOLUNTEER ASSISTANT\n\n Join our team and be trained to identify all local parrots by sight and sound. You’ll conduct parrot censuses in the forest and at clay licks, locate foraging parrots, and enter collected data into our system. During the macaw breeding season, you’ll learn to climb trees using rope systems and observe macaw behavior around nests. Additional duties include campsite setup and cooking. \n\nSHORT VOLUNTEER ASSISTANT\n\nIn this role, you will receive quick training to assist our field team in monitoring macaw nests from the ground, supporting the team that works with ropes. You will also be trained to monitor macaw behavior around nests and help with clay lick observations. Due to the shorter stay, involvement in activities like parrot censuses and tree climbing will be limited. Other responsibilities include campsite setup and cooking. \n\nSPONSORED LONG TERM VOLUNTEER POSITION\n\nBe part of the “Harrison's Bird Foods Internship in the Rainforest Program”! You will receive comprehensive training similar to our long-term volunteers, including parrot identification, conducting censuses, monitoring foraging behaviors, tracking tree species macaws use, and entering data. In addition to tree climbing and nest observation, you’ll also assist with macaw chick health checks, including taking biometric measurements. You’ll play a key role in our nest monitoring expeditions throughout the Tambopata River basin. As with all positions, activities include campsite setup and cooking. \n\nQUALIFICATIONS\n\nLONG-TERM VOLUNTEER ASSISTANT REQUIREMENTS:\n\nCandidates must have previous field experience and experience working with birds. A degree in Biology, Ecology, Forestry, Wildlife Sciences, or a related field, or be close to graduation, is required. \n\nAdditional Requirements: Volunteers should be in good physical condition, able to carry a 40 lb (18 kg) pack over moderate terrain for up to 2 km, and must have no fear of heights, particularly during the macaw breeding season (Dec-Mar). They should be able to work well in a team, handle stressful and challenging situations, and have travel insurance coverage\n\nSHORT-TERM VOLUNTEER ASSISTANT REQUIREMENTS \n\nApplicants should have some experience observing animals, either in the wild or in captivity, along with an appreciation for nature and wildlife. \n\nAdditional Requirements:   \nVolunteers need to be in average physical condition, capable of walking 2 km over moderate terrain. They should have strong observational skills, the ability to remain seated for long periods of time, and a basic knowledge of birds. Travel insurance coverage is also required.\n\nSPONSORED LONG TERM VOLUNTEER POSITION\n\nThis position is available immediately, with a start date of November 28, 2024. Candidates must have previous field experience and experience working with birds, along with a degree or be in the final semesters of studies in Biology, Ecology, Forestry, or a related field. Some level of Spanish proficiency is also necessary.\n\nAdditional Requirements: Volunteers must be in good physical condition, able to carry a 40 lb (18 kg) pack over moderate terrain for up to 2 km and have no fear of heights (Dec-May). They should have a positive attitude toward facing new and challenging situations, be able to work well in a team under stress and have travel insurance coverage.\n\nACCOMODATIONS\n\nOur headquarters are located in the Malinoski Biological Station which is located right where the Malinoski river joins the Tambopata River. The station is a two-story wooden house with electricity generated by a gasoline generator and 75 Gb internet. The rooms are for two people and bathrooms and showers are shared. The first floor has a large area for common use of the different teams of researchers who stay there.\n\nCOST\nEssentially, volunteering is free. We take care of research permit costs, cover the costs of all staff, work to maintain training material, and also deal with all correspondence and various aspects of project management. However, our budget does not extend to being able to pay for all aspects of volunteer participation. As such you only need to cover food, accommodation, and other services provided by the field station. The costs are very reasonable. The daily fee is according to the position and experience:\n\n• Long-term assistant: 30 USD/day \n\n• Short-term assistant: 45 USD/day \n\n• SPONSORED Long-term assistant: NO COST (Thanks to the generous sponsorship from Harrison's Bird Foods) \n\n\n*A one-time processing fee of $30 will be added for all volunteers.\nThis rate covers food (3 meals per day) and accommodations (bedding is provided). All volunteers will be charged an airport transfer to be picked up ($20) or dropped off ($10) at the airport plus an extra cost to be transported to the port in private transportation ($45). Once a volunteer was accepted, they will be sent an invoice by email from Texas A&M University. Upon receipt, the volunteer needs to pay 20% of the total cost of their stay. This non-refundable payment is required to hold the reservation for the assistant. The remaining 80% of the payment should be made at least two weeks before the assistant arrives at the release site. Arrangements can be made if assistants wish to pay in cash in the country. However, prior permission from the coordinator is needed. Changes to the daily fee may apply according to availability and season\n\n\nContact\nDr. Gabriela Vigo-Trauco\nvolunteering@themacawsociety.org (preferred contact method)",

The preferred start date is September 1, 2025. \n\nThe University of Colorado is an Equal Opportunity Employer and complies with all applicable federal, state, and local laws governing nondiscrimination in employment. We are committed to creating a workplace where all individuals are treated with respect and dignity, and we encourage individuals from all backgrounds to apply, including protected veterans and individuals with disabilities.\n\nKey Responsibilities:\nConduct bioenergetics modeling focused on current and future ecosystem stressors such as temperature and food availability in lake systems across Alaska national parks. You will contribute to a regionally applicable model for lake trout across Alaska that may be useful for parks service managers in Alaska and the western United States and assist with the setting up a new laboratory. This work is a collaboration between the University of Colorado-Boulder, the National Parks Service, and the U.S. Geological Survey, within a new lab established by Dr. Peyton Thomas (PI). Primary responsibilities will include: Computer modeling: Compile and analyze environmental, diet, life history data for lake trout populations of interest. We aim to develop a regional Alaska late trout bioenergetics model using Fish Bioenergetics 4.0 that can be used to project future population conditions and provide insight for introduced lake trout populations in other western US National Parks Service units. Therefore, we are looking for a highly motivated individual with experience collecting or using biological data, modeling experience, and experience working with large datasets. General support: This is a brand new lab, so we will begin our lab setup during the time of this PRA! If located in Boulder, beginning in 2026, assist with the setup the new laboratory, including organizing sample archives, research, assemble and maintain equipment, and creating a database of protocols (lab, field, and modeling), and recent field and lab data. Work with PI on obtaining biological permits. Fieldwork: There is a possibility of fieldwork in Lake Clark National Park, AK in Summer 2026 for this position. Here we aim to collect fish morphometric data and tissue samples for an assessment of body condition of multiple life stages to begin model validation. Therefore, we are looking for an individual with fieldwork experience and a willingness to be in remote areas with fishing equipment and handle biological material.

Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency’s mission and motivates their work across the agency. It’s been there from the agency’s very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the USDA Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.\n\nThe International Institute of Tropical Forestry (the Institute), headquartered in Río Piedras, Puerto Rico, is a research and technology transfer institute that is dedicated to advancing tropical forestry on insular, national, and international levels, and developing and exchanging knowledge critical to sustaining benefits of tropical forests and grasslands.  The IITF mission is to develop and disseminate scientifically based knowledge that contributes to the conservation of forests, wildlife, and watersheds of the American tropics in the context of environmental change. Current foci include silviculture and forest dynamics, wildfire risk management and forest inventory. The Research and Development mission of the USFS is to develop and deliver knowledge and innovative technology to improve management of the Nation's forests and grasslands—both public and private including National Forest lands.\n\nProposed Project: The participant will conduct landscape-scale research with existing forest inventory and geospatial data to improve techniques and knowledge in one of three priority areas: forest inventory and analysis, timber production and forest dynamics, or wildfire risk management. The focus will be on mixed species forests of the U.S., including but not limited to subtropical zones. Potential topics include research to improve the precision of forest inventory estimates of trends in timber and non-timber forest products with remote sensing and other geospatial data, or to improve forest management and reduce wildfire risk through improved understanding of the dynamics of economically valuable species and invasive species that may compete with economically valuable species or promote wildfire.\n\nLearning Objectives: The postdoctoral fellow will have the opportunity to apply their experience and knowledge to a new geographic area and set of tree species. They will also have opportunities to present analyses and outputs in workshops, seminars, reports and peer-reviewed publications developed and co-authored with mentors and collaborators. Outputs will be shared with forest managers from industry, the public sector, other landowners and other scientists and land managers.\n\nMentor: The mentors for this opportunity are  Eileen Helmer (eileen.helmer@usda.gov) and Tamara Heartsill-Scalley (tamara.heartsill-scalley@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentors.\n\nAnticipated Appointment Start Date: August 2025.  Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.\n\nAppointment Length: The appointment will initially be for at least eleven months but may be extended upon recommendation of USDA Forest Service and is contingent on the availability of funds.\n\nLevel of Participation: The appointment is full time.\n\nParticipant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend at the post-doctoral level is $72,000 (11-months). Additionally, the medical and dental insurance supplement is $6,547, and travel support to present research findings is $2,250. \n\nCitizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents (LPR), and foreign nationals.

The Michigan State Bird Observatory (MSBO) operates two banding stations, the Burke Lake Banding Station (BULA) and the Corey Marsh Banding Station (CMBS), which are both located near East Lansing, Michigan. The MSBO has three key mission areas: research of avian health and migration, education of current and future ornithological professionals, and outreach for our community. All crew members are expected to contribute to all three mission areas as a core function of their positions.\n\nThe stations collectively capture over 6,000 birds per fall field season of 85 – 88 species. Daily captures can exceed 200 birds. Each station opens nets 30 minutes prior to sunrise and closes nets 5 – 5.5 hours post-sunrise (banding often continues later into the morning). BULA has 28 mist-nets and is open 7 days a week, weather permitting, and CMBS has 15 mist-nets and is open 3 days per week. Education and outreach are a key part of our mission; hence, the stations are always open to the public and will host educational programs.\n\nTo maintain consistent data collection, there is only one bander at each station per morning. The bander is responsible for efficiently and safely handling all new and recaptured birds. They must have excellent species identification skills – particularly eastern landbirds, which include many ‘confusing fall warblers’. A complete list of species captured can be found on our website. The bander must be able to age birds using skull and molt limits. The bander will be responsible for assessing condition – through scoring of fat stores and muscle, taking morphological measurements, and examining birds for ectoparasites (i.e., ticks). When not banding, the individual will assist with extracting birds from mist-nets and training student assistants in extraction (using body-first method). The bander will work closely each day with 2 data recorders (often volunteers) and must communicate clearly and effectively to maintain accuracy of data collection. Additionally, the bander will need to be a willing and effective communicator with visitors, show visitors birds, share the banding process, and answer questions. Other responsibilities include assisting with the upkeep and maintenance of the study sites (i.e., net and boardwalk repair), assisting with social media posts, and doing data entry. The bander is responsible for getting up 1 – 1.5 hours earlier than net-opening to check weather and make a call on whether there will be a delay in opening nets and communicate with the entire crew via text.The banding season ends on October 15th, but there may be potential opportunities to stay on an additional week to help with data management.\n\nBanders will be part of a crew that each morning includes 1 bander, 2 – 3 mist-net assistants, 1 – 2 students in our mist-netting training assistantship program, 1 outreach specialist, and 1 – 2 volunteer data recorders.\n\nThe individual will need to be successfully sub-permitted under Dr. Jen Owen’s Master Banding Permit.\n\nA reliable personal vehicle, valid driver’s license, and auto insurance are required. Hiring is contingent upon passing a background check through Michigan State University.\n\nThere are tent-camping (“glamping”) accommodations available at the Corey Marsh Ecological Research Center – including, full bathroom, small indoor and outdoor kitchenettes, and a structure over the tents (which are provided). These are free accommodations with the expectation of all “glamping” crew members contributing to upkeep and cleaning of the spaces used by them.\n\nDesired Qualifications\n\nThe bander must have excellent species identification skills – particularly eastern landbirds, which include many “confusing fall warblers”. The bander must be able to age birds using skull and molt limits. The bander will be responsible for assessing condition – through scoring of fat stores and muscle, taking morphological measurements, and examining birds for ectoparasites (i.e., ticks). Additionally, the bander will need to be a willing and effective communicator with visitors, show visitors birds, share the banding process with them, and answer questions. Banders should also have a strong interest in and ability to train our student assistants.\n\nEqual Employment Opportunity Statement\n\nAll qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, citizenship, age, disability or protected veteran status.\n\nRequired Application Materials\n\nLetter of interest detailing relevant experience banding and identifying eastern landbirds. Please also address your interest and qualifications in training in extraction and conducting outreach.\nRésumé, including estimated banding and extraction totals\nThe names, phone numbers, and email addresses of 3 references familiar with your banding experience\nWork Hours\n\no All the work will occur at our field stations, Burke Lake Banding Station in Bath, MI and the Corey Marsh Ecological Research Center in Laingsburg, MI. At least one station is open every day of the week, including weekends. Each workday ranges from 1 hour prior to sunrise and may extend until 2pm (depending on number of birds and weather).\n\nSummary of Physical Demands\n\nWalking on wet and uneven terrain\n\nContact\nJen Owen\nowenj@msu.edu (preferred contact method)",

While all conservation actions on the ground must eventually be applied at the site scale, the “landscape-scale” has been recommended for decades as a suitable scale for planning. The landscape scale brings in ecological and socioeconomic context to inform decisions by understanding ecological connections and flows, population-level information about species, human stressors affecting sites but originating outside of them, and policy. This course will explore the key concepts and some tricky challenges of conducting conservation planning at the landscape scale, including how site-scale implementing actions can flow from a landscape-scale plan.  The course will draw on the Conservation Standards and other frameworks but will address the multi-disciplinary needs and tools of landscape planning including spatial analyses and optimization, incorporating socioeconomic factors and community input, the importance of partners, and how to sustain what must be a dynamic effort into the future. Eight guest instructors from multiple organizations around the world will augment the course with their specific expertise and experience. \n DATES \nSTANDARD and PREMIUM formats:\nLive (recorded) meetings 24 September – 22 October, 2025; 11:00 a.m. – 1:00 p.m. EDT on Wednesdays and Fridays each week (except October 8).

Interns will be helping with the day-to-day operations, as well as guiding clients. The ranch is 9,000 acres, with 5,000 of these acres devoted to high quality white-tailed deer management and hunting. This portion of the property is high fenced and is participating in the M.L.D. Program from the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. The remainder of the ranch is focused on exotic ungulate hunting. We have breeding populations of many exotic species, all of which will be hunted each fall.  (axis, fallow, aoudad, sika, kudu, wildebeest etc.) Since our interns will be guiding clients, a strong background in hunting is needed.  Due to many clients booking weekends, as well as weekdays, expect to put in a lot of hours each week. Each intern will be issued a video camera to record animals during scouting, and recordings will be reviewed as a group with ranch staff.   Interns will stay on the ranch, with housing provided, and a truck will be issued for general ranch work and guiding. Interns will be paid monthly, and all guide tips will be split between full time staff and intern guides.\n\nFall internship / hunting guide duties\nDeer blind maintenance\nClearing brush for shooting lanes\nFilling feeders\nScouting and videoing animals for future hunts\nGuiding hunters\nField dressing harvested animals\nPreparing animals for taxidermy\nHarvest does and undesirable bucks with MLDP tags\nHarvest feral pigs\nKeep intern house clean and tidy\nGeneral ranch maintenance\n\nApplicants must have completed a minimum of 60 hours or be a recent graduate of a wildlife or range related field of study. Interns must be able to work alone as well as in groups. A passion for hunting is a must due to the long hours each day and the length of the season.  Guides must be personable, and respectful while guiding all hunts. The internship is from mid-August to mid-January. There is some flexibility with the start and conclusion dates due to different school schedules.  (If mutually agreed upon, at the end of the guiding season, the internship may be lengthened to include our spring internship.) Please send a cover letter, resume, transcript and references via email to apply.  The positions will be filled as soon as quality applications are received. \n\nContact\nKeith Lake\n8306881274\nkeithlake@flyingaranch.net (preferred contact method)",

The opportunity is located in Kodiak, Alaska.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) formed the National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS) in 1999 as the focal point for NOAA’s coastal ocean science efforts. NCCOS uses cutting-edge research and high-tech instrumentation to provide citizens, coastal managers, public health officials, and other decision makers with reliable information needed to determine how best to protect environmental resources and public health, preserve valued habitats, and improve the way communities interact with coastal ecosystems. The NCCOS is headquartered in Silver Spring, MD but also has research labs across the nation. The NCCOS also has many assets including research programs, vessels, satellites, science centers, laboratories, and a vast pool of distinguished scientists and experts.\n\nThe HAB-F Branch delivers near real-time forecasting products for predicting the intensity/severity, location, and the potential health risk HABs pose in the Great Lakes and coastal regions of the U.S. While national in scope, forecasting efforts and products address regional needs and specific HAB species. The product sets are intended to support coastal resource managers, public health officials, researchers, and the public.\n\nResearch Project: Under the guidance of a technical mentor, the selected participant will gain experience in various research activities including performing and otherwise supporting collection of field data, including use of oceanographic monitoring instruments, collection of water, sediment and/or tissue samples and other activities. As well as conducting laboratory studies including toxin analysis, microscopy, molecular methods development and validation, and data analytics. This opportunity will also include engagement with, and training of, stakeholders in Alaska as well as generating outreach materials and technical documentation.\n\nThe specific project includes supporting ongoing research efforts in Alaska in support of HAB forecast development. Alaska experiences annual blooms of the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella, as well as other HAB species that can cause shellfish toxicity and vector toxins through the marine food web. There is a need for better monitoring and HAB forecasting products to help mitigate these blooms but much of Alaska is lacking in environmental monitoring data to support a HAB forecasting effort. The overarching goal of this project is to learn about data collection for HAB monitoring, and to help support forecasting data collection to mitigate the impacts of such blooms. This will involve collaborating with a variety of NOAA partners and interacting with stakeholders to support data collection from water, plankton and other biota, collection of environmental data with oceanographic sensors, and supporting laboratory processing of samples for analysis. \n\nLearning Objectives: The fellow will:\n\nDevelop an understanding of Alexandrium blooms, the cause of paralytic shellfish poisoning in Alaska.\nGain familiarity in keeping field data records and collection of data with oceanographic instruments.\nGain familiarity with collection of seawater, plankton, fish and invertebrates for microscopy and toxin analysis.\nGain familiarity with processing samples of seawater, plankton, sediment and biota for analysis.\nGain experience collaborating with diverse sets of partners and stakeholders.\nLearn about HAB-F capabilities in monitoring and modeling, including exposure to hydrographic and other field data, and maintaining laboratory and field records.\nMentor: The mentor for this opportunity is Steven Kibler (steve.kibler@noaa.gov), with co-mentor Julie Matweyou (jamatweyou@alaska.edu).

Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency’s mission and motivates their work across the agency. It’s been there from the agency’s very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the USDA Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.\n\nResearch Project: The primary project focus of the research is to support successful planning for landscape management to enhance risk reduction from wildfire and climate to forests and wildlife. These objectives will be addressed through landscape modeling of a variety of resource conditions and benefits related to forest conditions and as affected by climate change, wildfire, and forest management.  Specific applications will require using ForSys optimization models, FVS models, and using outputs from Landis-II dynamic landscape models.\n\nDecision support tools are becoming essential tools to help organizations and regional and national government agencies with weighing the costs and benefits of actions, assessing optimal solutions based on spatial or nonspatial criteria, or modeling scenarios based on specific assumptions and data. They focus on biophysical and economic outcomes of resource management and restoration, but can also provide guidance in social decision making, governance and negotiation among stakeholders. Decision support tool development and application is another focus of the fellow, which consists of the development of software programs that provide a platform for quantifying and comparing ecological and social costs and benefits, and identifying the existence of patterns and thresholds to inform management and conservation actions across landscapes and over time.  Specific software programs to be used include PROMOTE and the Ecosystem Management Decision Support tool, as well as ForSys Scenario Investment Planning software (e.g., Alan Ager DST).\n\nThe fellow is expected to develop and maintain collaborative relationships with scientists and partners in other agencies and institutions and universities.  Skills in balancing the competing demands of multiple simultaneous collaborations will be important for the ultimate success of the fellow. In many cases, the fellow will be a part of a team to develop common data layers that can be used by a suite of scientists from multiple disciplines to understand the complexities of environmental responses to disturbances and change, including retrospective and prospective analyses and researching with spatial analysts and modelers to construct or reconstruct environmental data layers for analysis. Assembles technical information, performs analyses, prepares technical reports, and participates in writing peer-reviewed journal papers, and participates in professional conferences. The fellow will disseminate scientific results through published literature, symposia, presentations, and workshops. \n\nLearning Objectives: The fellow will be exposed to teams of tenured scientists across diverse disciplines and geographies, and helping to develop products directly relevant and applicable to land management. Through collaborating with scientists from across the country, learning how they approach their science conduct and delivery, and in turn providing innovative ideas and collaboration in science delivery.  They will collaborate with scientists across California, building a strong network of colleagues and partners in future research activities. They will collaborate with a wide array of State and Federal agency managers, learning about the challenges that they face and how research and science delivery can help support their research. They will research with decision support tool development, and learn about how DSTs can best meet the need of putting complex scientific information in the hands of managers in a readily accessible and defensible manner. \n\nMentor: The mentor for this opportunity is Pat Manley (patricia.manley@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor.\n\nAnticipated Appointment Start Date: March 2025.  Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.\n\nAppointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year but may be extended upon recommendation of USDA Forest Service and is contingent on the availability of funds.\n\nLevel of Participation: The appointment is full time.\n\nParticipant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend range is $4,000 to $6,000 per month.\n\nCitizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents (LPR), and foreign nationals. Non-U.S. citizen applicants should refer to the Guidelines for Non-U.S. Citizens Details page of the program website for information about the valid immigration statuses that are acceptable for program participation.

This individual placement is in partnership with the National Park Service and is an AmeriCorps Position. SECC empowers young adults to cultivate compassion, responsibility, and grit through community service, and environmental stewardship. SECC selects young adults, ages 18-30, to complete conservation projects on public lands throughout the Southeast. SECC programs encourage environmental stewardship, foster community partnerships, and emphasize experiential learning. SECC serves a diverse population that is representative of the Southeast, including youth, graduates, veterans, and a cross-section of ethnicities and income levels. \n\nCongaree National Park is the largest intact expanse of old-growth bottomland hardwood forest remaining in the southeastern United States. Waters from the Congaree and Wateree Rivers sweep through the floodplain, carrying nutrients and sediments that nourish and rejuvenate this ecosystem and support the growth of national and state-champion trees. The National Park Service preserves unimpaired the natural and cultural resources and values of the National Park System for the enjoyment, education, and inspiration of this and future generations. The National Park Service cooperates with partners to extend the benefits of natural and cultural resource conservation and outdoor recreation throughout this country and the world.\n\nPosition Overview:\n\nThe team will have a direct positive impact on Congaree by performing restoration efforts in a National Park. Their actions will directly promote the restoration, well-being, and conservation of wetlands, longleaf pine ecosystems, and rare species.

Our team members go above and beyond, bringing initiative, integrity, and a strong work ethic to every project. Collaboration is key—we thrive on teamwork, open communication, and diverse perspectives. In a field that constantly changes, we value those who are resilient, adaptable, and resourceful in the face of challenges. If you're intellectually curious, eager to learn, and ready to help restore ecosystems and protect natural resources, you’ll find your place here.\n\nRES is looking for a Scientist I (Part-Time) to join our team.\n\nAs a Scientist I at RES, you’ll support field data collection, environmental monitoring, and ecological assessments that form the foundation of our restoration and mitigation projects. Working under the direction of experienced scientists and project managers, you’ll contribute to meaningful work in the field—collecting and processing data, supporting reporting efforts, and gaining exposure to environmental regulations, ecosystems, and scientific best practices.\n\nThis is an entry-level opportunity ideal for a recent graduate or someone early in their career who is passionate about environmental science, ecology, or natural resources and wants to build a strong foundation for long-term growth.

Approximately 70–80% of your time will be spent in the field, supporting current projects in Polk County and surrounding areas. This role will require about 30 hours a week initially with the potential to grow in to a full time role.

Quantifying zooplankton diversity and abundance is vital for monitoring ecosystem health, but traditional methods based on microscopy are labor-intensive and often provide limited taxonomic resolution. Metabarcoding offers promise of faster, cheaper, more accurate, and higher-resolution characterization of zooplankton biodiversity. However, these methods can be limited by primer biases, incomplete reference databases, and challenges in accurately reflecting organismal biomass. Shotgun metagenomics - sequencing all DNA present in a sample without the need for targeted amplification - may provide a more comprehensive and unbiased view of community composition. This approach has the potential to offer a more accurate estimate of relative abundance, but its performance and practicality for application on complex real-world tissue mixtures has not yet been validated. Accordingly, both metabarcoding and metagenomic approaches will need careful context-specific evaluation and benchmarking against traditional approaches prior to any large-scale implementation in monitoring programs. This position offers the exciting opportunity to assess the performance of these emerging techniques in a real-world monitoring program and help shape the future of aquatic ecosystem assessment.\n KEY RESPONSIBILITIES:\nThe project will generate side-by-side comparisons of results from metabarcoding, metagenomics, and traditional microscopy on samples collected by the Hudson River Lower Food Web Monitoring Program. The postdoc is expected to lead efforts in the following five areas:\n·      Design and refine experimental and laboratory protocols for DNA extraction and library preparation from bulk tissue and water samples\n·      Analyze high-throughput sequencing data and optimize bioinformatic pipelines for both metabarcoding and metagenomic workflows\n·      Build and curate taxonomic reference databases from public repositories and de novo sequencing\n·      Collaborate with partners and regional stakeholders and co-organize annual workshops to promote knowledge exchange\n·      Prepare peer-reviewed publications and presentations for both scientific and broader audiences\n DESIRED QUALIFICATIONS:\n·      A Ph.D. in molecular ecology, bioinformatics, evolutionary biology, environmental genomics, or a related field\n·      Demonstrated experience with metabarcoding, metagenomics, or other environmental DNA applications\n·      Proficiency in programming and bioinformatics tools for high-throughput sequence analysis\n·      Excellent organizational skills, attention to detail, and ability to work both independently and collaboratively in a team environment.\n·      Strong written and verbal communication skills\n·      Commitment to fostering an inclusive and supportive research environment\n            TERMS OF APPOINTMENT:\nThis is a full-time position starting in late summer 2025 (or as soon as possible thereafter). The initial appointment is for 12 months, with the potential for renewal based on performance and available funding.

Recreational fishing is a core socioeconomic activity in the region, with 1 in 5 Florida anglers fishing the coastal Everglades and generating billions in economic activity. Yet, our understanding of the patterns of recreational catch and effort and their dependency on hydrology, including ongoing restoration efforts, and climate remains limited.\n\nCoastal fisheries are hypothesized to respond to both press and pulse disturbances, with pulse disturbances impacting recruitment events and press disturbances regulating overall population performance. Thus, the goals of the study, using fisheries dependent an environmental data, are threefold: 1) To examine spatiotemporal patterns in angler catch and effort in the Everglades recreational fishery, 2) To link these spatiotemporal trends to hydroclimatic drivers and restoration actions, and 3) To evaluate the utility of fisheries-dependent data and provide recommendations for future monitoring. Available data sets include a dockside angler survey that spans over 40 years and is one of the longest and most valuable fisheries-dependent datasets in Florida, along with hydrological and climate data streams.\n\nThe position provides a unique opportunity to work collaboratively in an academic institution-government agency partnership with the goal of increasing our understanding of coastal processes and restoration effects and of improving recreational fisheries management. We are part of a highly collaborative South Florida research community, composed of scientists, federal, state, private partners, and stakeholders (see http://fcelter.fiu.edu/ and https://crestcache.fiu.edu/), and thus opportunities for collaborative team science, participation in other projects, engagement with resource managers and anglers, and mentoring graduate and undergraduate students are available.\n\nRequirements: A Ph.D. in ecology, fisheries, quantitative ecology, biology, or related field is required. Applicants must have a demonstrated record of publication in peer-reviewed journals, and excellent coding skills in R. The selected candidate must pass a U.S. government tier 1 (non-sensitive) background check and complete NPS cybersecurity training. This position requires frequent in-person work at both FIU and NPS offices in Miami, FL.\n\nPreferred qualifications: The ideal candidate has excellent quantitative skills and a passion for fisheries. Experience and interest working with fisheries-dependent data, robust causation analytical approaches, stock assessment tools, using collaborative team science approaches, and engagement with anglers and resource managers are desired.\n\nHow To Apply: Please email Dr. Jenn Rehage at rehagej@fiu.edu and Dr. Rolando Santos rsantosc@fiu.edu with the subject line ‘Postdoc 2025 + your name.’ In your email, please include (as a single PDF):\n- Cover letter describing experience, interests & expertise relevant to position & career goals\n- CV with list of 3 references\n- Examples of products (peer-reviewed publications, data & code packages, GitHub repositories, popular articles, outreach products, etc.)\n\nAbout FIU & SFNRC:\nFlorida International University is Miami’s public research university and Florida’s youngest preeminent universities, and one of the youngest R1 research universities (highest research activity) in the US. FIU is also the largest majority-minority serving institution in the country, and ranked the second most impactful university in the nation, the No. 3 best public university in the US, and among the top 20 public universities contributing to the public good. The Coastal Fisheries & Seascape Labs focus on how fishes and recreational fisheries track anthropogenic disturbance and seascape change, and conducts research to inform management, conservation, and restoration efforts in partnership with stakeholders to coproduce science that is both fundamental and actionable. \n\nThe National Park Service’s South Florida Natural Resources Center has a unique science mission to address the impacts and progress of Everglades restoration, the largest and most expensive ecosystem restoration project in history. The Center serves four park units including Everglades National Park, Biscayne National Park, Dry Tortugas National Park, and Big Cypress National Preserve. There are 50 staff across 4 offices organized by four main groups: Restoration Sciences, Biological Sciences, Data Sciences, and Resiliency and Sustainability. \n\nContact\nJenn Rehage amd Rolando Santos\nrehagej@fiu.edu (preferred contact method)",

    "description": "SEATRU 2025 Sea Turtle Conservation Internship Position\nSea Turtle Research Unit (State) | https://seatru.umt.edu.my/\nDetails\nPosting:\nhttps://seatru.umt.edu.my/\nApplication Deadline:\n08/15/2025\nPublished:\n01/01/2025\nStarting Date:\nafter 4/20/2025\nEnding Date:\nafter 10/12/2025\nHours per Week:\n40 - 60\nSalary:\nnone\nEducation Required:\nSome Undergraduate\nExperience Required:\nnone\nLocation:\nChagar Hutang Turtle Sanctuary (Malaysia)\nDescription\nThe Sea Turtle Research Unit (SEATRU) has been working to protect endangered green and hawksbill turtles nesting at the Chagar Hutang Sea Turtle Sanctuary for over 30 years. SEATRU’s dedicated work to conserve one of Malaysia’s most important nesting sites has helped to increase the number of successful nests laid at Chagar Hutang to over 2,000 each year. Beyond monitoring nesting turtles and ensuring hatchlings emerge from their nests, SEATRU’s grassroots conservation efforts have helped to protect the natural beauty of this remote island location – think crescent-shaped palm-fringed beach, lush tropical jungle, and vibrant coral reefs. \n\nSEATRU's main goal is the long-term monitoring and conservation of nesting turtles at our Chagar Hutang site. We work closely with experienced local rangers to help guide our nesting beach monitoring programs. In addition, Chagar Hutang serves as a natural laboratory for postgraduate students and undergraduate interns to carry out a variety of independent research projects at the site. With over 2,000 nests laid at the beach between April and October each year, Chagar Hutang can be a busy place after dark, with mother turtles coming and going through all hours of the night. \n\nTo help us locate every nest, SEATRU runs an annual volunteer program to assist our rangers with their nighttime turtle monitoring efforts. Once a week during the nesting season, different groups of volunteers join our project to live and work together, and to experience grassroots sea turtle conservation efforts and the local island lifestyle at our remote sea turtle sanctuary site. Our program’s volunteers come from diverse backgrounds throughout Malaysia and abroad and often share how their experiences at Chagar Hutang were a ‘once-in-a-lifetime’ event. \n\n\nDuties: \n\nInterns will work closely alongside SEATRU’s Conservation Rangers at Chagar Hutang to lead volunteer groups in collecting data on nesting sea turtles, marking nest sites, and performing nest checks to monitor the health of hatchlings and ensure their emergence success. Interns are responsible for correctly and accurately managing nesting data, including compiling nesting data from night patrol into handwritten logbooks at the research station. Interns help direct and assist volunteers in food preparation, station upkeep, and outdoor activities, like jungle trekking, kayaking, and snorkeling. Furthermore, SEATRU interns regularly engage with public tourists visiting the nesting beach for educational day trips or assist with school group camping trips. \n\nInterns will learn how to: \n\n·         Identify sea turtle tracks, including false crawls, nesting attempts, and successful nests. \n·         Measure a nesting turtle’s carapace, apply and read identification tags, and conduct photo ID. \n·         Mark a nest site, complete individual nesting data forms, and manage data records in the field. \n·         Excavate nests to inventory hatching and emergence success, and release baby sea turtles. \n·         Educate the public about the threats sea turtles face and how we can work to conserve them. \n·         Lead diverse groups of people, challenge themselves, and make new friends. \n\nInterns will receive preliminary training by SEATRU staff before the start of the internship, and support from rangers and staff throughout their stay. However, fieldwork can be strenuous. Night patrols require walking between nesting turtles across soft beach sands. During the day, there is the risk of sun exposure as Malaysia is a tropical country, with hot and humid weather conditions, frequent showers, and thunderstorms. \n\nPrivate same-sex housing is provided for interns at the Chagar Hutang Research Station, however, the kitchen, office and common-use areas are open to the surrounding environment, including the insects, geckos, and spiders that live there. Chagar Hutang's pristine natural environment is also home to many beautiful birds, curious monkeys, and unique species of snakes and lizards. Furthermore, Chagar Hutang's coral reefs host a multitude of colorful and diverse tropical fish, friendly reef sharks, and resident turtles. \n\n Requirements: \n\n·         College students or recent graduates who are responsible, adaptable, motivated to learn, and passionate about marine conservation. \n·         Must be able to perform physically demanding work, including but not limited to walking long distances in soft sand, handling high temperatures, humidity, stormy weather, and insects, withstanding exposure to intense sunlight, kneeling and digging in hot/heavy/wet sand, and carrying up to 30 lbs. \n·         A commitment to participate in the program for at least 8 weeks, though longer (12-16 weeks) is preferred. \n·         International applicants must have or obtain a valid passport and purchase international travel insurance to cover the duration of their time in Malaysia. \n·         A minimum of 18 years of age and engaged in or recently completed undergraduate studies. \n\n Benefits/Costs: \n\nThere is no direct compensation for the SEATRU internship position. However, interns may receive a small stipend depending on their overall performance at the end of their internship period. Interns will be responsible for their transportation, international and domestic, to SEATRU’s office located at Universiti Malaysia Terengganu in Kuala Terengganu, Peninsular Malaysia. Transportation to and from the Chagar Hutang Research Station on Redang Island, as well as room and board while staying at the station, will be compensated by SEATRU. \n\n Application/Contact Information: \n\nTo apply, please email your cover letter, detailing your interest in a Sea Turtle Conservation Internship position with SEATRU, along with your resume or CV and two references’ contact information to turtle@umt.edu.my. \n\n\n\nContact\nSEATRU office\nturtle@umt.edu.my.

We engage youth (age 15-17) and young adults (ages 18-30, up to 35 for veterans) in service projects on public lands throughout the Southeast. Our AmeriCorps positions provide impactful educational and service opportunities that benefit both communities and landscapes. SECC’s participants reflect the population of the Southeast region, including youth, graduates, veterans, and individuals from various ethnic and economic backgrounds.  \n SECC collaborates with land management agencies such as the United States Forest Service, National Park Service, State Parks, local municipalities, and non-profits to host day and camping crews. Our projects vary but include trail construction and maintenance, restoration of natural areas, invasive species removal, fire fuels reduction, fencing, herbicide applications, and more. Most projects involve strenuous manual labor and require hiking to and from the project sites daily, carrying tools and day packs.   \n    SECC camping crews serve in frontcountry and backcountry locations, often in challenging weather conditions. While hitch schedules vary by project and location, they typically follow a 9-day on, 5-day off pattern, with 10-hour shifts and scheduled breaks throughout the day. While we aim to maintain consistency, flexibility is expected as schedules, times, and project locations are subject to change based on project needs.      \n    SECC is an independent, non-residential program, and crew members are responsible for securing their own housing when not in the field. On-hitch, crews manage camp chores and prepare all their own meals, with evenings often including group discussions. Members must provide their own personal outdoor gear (e.g., tent, sleeping bag, sleeping pad, day pack, multi-day pack, work pants, hiking/work boots), while SECC provides group camp equipment, tools, protective gear and transportation between SECC Office and project sites.   \n    Description of Duties — Position Summary \n\nSoutheast Conservation Corps (SECC) Strike Team has partnered with a range of land managers across the Southeast, including the U.S. Forest Service at Bankhead National Forest, The Nature Conservancy (TNC) in South Carolina, and Tennessee State Parks. This multi-agency initiative is rooted in a shared commitment to restoring land integrity, enhancing visitor experiences, and preparing young adults for careers in conservation. \n\n\nCrews should anticipate some hitches in rugged backcountry conditions and will be camping in remote, primitive settings to complete essential conservation projects.  \n\n\n \n\n\nService Project: \n\nMembers of the Strike Team should expect a wide array of land management projects. During their time in the field, crew members camp overnight and serve outdoors in all weather conditions, performing heavy manual labor related to environmental conservation and restoration projects.  Most projects require hiking out to project sites for the day with tools, equipment, and a day pack. Projects can include the following, but are not limited to: \n\nBrush and log out trail corridors.  \nMitigate drainage issues through water diversion methods, stepping stones, and natural surface improvements.  \nRepair creek crossings and eroded segments to enhance trail navigability and reduce sedimentation.  \nDecommission and obscure unauthorized user-created trails.  \nTimber step installation  \nTrail tread repair and widening  \nStone stair improvements or installation  \nCommunity Service\n \n\nCrew Life:    \nSECC crews consist of 4-6 crew members and 2 crew leaders who provide project expertise, mentorship, training, and support to ensure the success of all participants. Food is provided while in the field, and crew members collaborate to plan meals and share chores, such as cooking and washing dishes. Most dietary restrictions can be accommodated if communicated in advance. Crew members must be prepared to camp, travel, complete service projects, and share meals as a team. No drug or alcohol consumption is allowed during service-related activities or travel at any time.   \n Crew members will need to supply their own personal equipment such as a day pack, work pants, hiking/work boots, etc. SECC will provide tools, protective gear and transportation between SECC office and project sites. SECC has a limited supply of loaner gear available for crew members to borrow. While this gear can be helpful, we strongly recommend that members bring as much of their own gear as possible, as the loaner equipment may not fully meet personal preferences or specific needs. \n SECC supports a culture of feedback and growth. Crew Members will set goals at the beginning of the season and review their performance through both self-evaluation and a review with their Crew Leader in the middle and at the end of their season. Evaluations will cover areas such as professionalism, responsibility and leadership, communication, engagement, productivity, safety, and equipment use. Crew Members will also be asked to evaluate their Crew Leaders’ performance, the overall program, and their experience at the end of their term.  \n  Hitch Schedule:     \nThis position will operate on a variable “hitch” schedule, but generally it will follow 9 days on and 5 days off for camping crews. Project days follow a 10-hour shift with scheduled time for breaks. While the staff at SECC strive to provide consistency throughout the season, personal flexibility is expected and should be prepared for when entering the term as schedules, times, and project locations are subject to change per project needs.  Applicants should be prepared to camp during hitches for the duration of the season, with lodging provided on a case-by-case basis if necessary.    \n   Requirements:     \n Minimum Qualifications:       \nUnited States citizen, United States national, or a lawful permanent resident alien \nMust be between ages 18 and 30, or up to 35 if a military veteran.   \nHas received a high school diploma or equivalency certificate; or has not dropped out of elementary or secondary school to enroll as an AmeriCorps participant, and agrees to obtain a high school diploma or its equivalent prior to using the education award \nAgrees to provide information to establish eligibility and to complete a National Service Criminal History Check. \nMust be over the age of 21 or have possessed a driver’s license for 3 or more years without any restrictions (to pass minimum insurability requirements for crew transport driving duties).       \nGeneral comfort with and prior experience in outdoor environments.  \nAdvanced trails techniques. 6 months of experience on trail improvement and features installation projects.

We engage youth (age 15-17) and young adults (ages 18-30, up to 35 for veterans) in service projects on public lands throughout the Southeast. Our AmeriCorps positions provide impactful educational and service opportunities that benefit both communities and landscapes. SECC’s participants reflect the population of the Southeast region, including youth, graduates, veterans, and individuals from various ethnic and economic backgrounds. SECC is also an active member of the AmeriCorps Disaster Response Team (A-DRT), and selected crews may be deployed on disaster response projects lasting up to 30 days. *If crew members are deployed for disaster response projects, comprehensive training will be provided. No prior knowledge or skillsets are required.* \n SECC collaborates with land management agencies such as the United States Forest Service, National Park Service, State Parks, local municipalities, and non-profits to host day and camping crews. Our projects vary but include trail construction and maintenance, restoration of natural areas, invasive species removal, fire fuels reduction, fencing, herbicide applications, and more. Most projects involve strenuous manual labor and require hiking to and from the project sites daily, carrying tools and day packs.  \n    SECC camping crews serve in frontcountry and backcountry locations, often in challenging weather conditions. While hitch schedules vary by project and location, they typically follow a 5-day on, 2-day off pattern, with 10-hour shifts and scheduled breaks throughout the day. While we aim to maintain consistency, flexibility is expected as schedules, times, and project locations are subject to change based on project needs.      \n    SECC is an independent, non-residential program, and crew members are responsible for securing their own housing when not in the field.

The primary focus of the project will be the restoration of Bullhead Trail, with additional projects in various park locations.

In addition to hiking 3-5 miles round trip per day there will be times participants will hike up to Mt. LeConte—an arduous level 5-mile trek each way with an elevation gain of approximately 3,000 feet—along with other tough hikes, all while carrying heavy loads of tools, equipment, and a day pack.  \n The GRSM Trail Program Coordinator will lead the crew and oversee restoration efforts. Members will camp overnight in the field and complete service projects outdoors in all weather conditions, performing manual labor related to conservation and restoration. Potential tasks include, but are not limited to: \nTrail construction and maintenance \nCorridor clearing \nReplacement of equestrian hitching posts \nRepair or installation of water structures along trails \nSignage installation and repainting blazes \nCampground maintenance \nHabitat restoration \nFence installation and repair \nCommunity Service \n Crew Life:    \nSECC crews consist of 4-6 crew members and 2 crew leaders who provide project expertise, mentorship, training, and support to ensure the success of all participants.

We engage youth (age 15-17) and young adults (ages 18-30, up to 35 for veterans) in service projects on public lands throughout the Southeast. Our AmeriCorps positions provide impactful educational and service opportunities that benefit both communities and landscapes. SECC’s participants reflect the population of the Southeast region, including youth, graduates, veterans, and individuals from various ethnic and economic backgrounds. \nSECC collaborates with land management agencies such as the United States Forest Service, National Park Service, State Parks, local municipalities, and non-profits to host day and camping crews. Our projects vary but include trail construction and maintenance, restoration of natural areas, invasive species removal, fire fuels reduction, fencing, herbicide applications, and more. Most projects involve strenuous manual labor and require hiking to and from the project sites daily, carrying tools and day packs.   \n  SECC camping crews serve in frontcountry and backcountry locations, often in challenging weather conditions. While hitch schedules vary by project and location, they typically follow a 9-day on, 5-day off pattern, with 10-hour shifts and scheduled breaks throughout the day. While we aim to maintain consistency, flexibility is expected as schedules, times, and project locations are subject to change based on project needs.  \n  SECC is an independent, non-residential program, and crew members are responsible for securing their own housing when not in the field. On-hitch, crews manage camp chores and prepare all their own meals, with evenings often including group discussions. Members must provide their own personal outdoor gear (e.g., tent, sleeping bag, sleeping pad, day pack, multi-day pack, work pants, hiking/work boots), while SECC provides group camp equipment, tools, protective gear and transportation between SECC Office and project sites. \n    Description of Duties — Position Summary \n Service Project:  \nSoutheast Conservation Corps (SECC) and Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area (LBL) have partnered to host a Recreation and Fire Prevention Crew. The crew will be based out of SECCs Chattanooga, TN office and travel to LBL to primarily support recreation and fire management operations. \nThe crew will be managed by LBL Forest Service staff and collaboratively aid in these pre-identified restoration projects. During their time in the field, crew members camp overnight and serve outdoors in all weather conditions, performing heavy manual labor related to environmental conservation and restoration projects. Most projects require hiking out to project sites for the day with tools, equipment, and a day pack.  \nThe projects will vary based on priorities and environmental factors but will focus on: \nHazard tree removal and sawyer work, including felling, bucking, limbing, swamping, etc.  \nTraditional trail building/maintenance, including logging out, brushing, reblazing, tread repair, water-bar installation, etc.   \nRecreation site improvements including trailhead and signage maintenance/replacement.  \nRestoration/stabilization of shelters and other structures \nEstablishment of prescribed fire containment line, completed with traditional wildland firefighting tools, such as: leaf blower, fire rake, rogue hoe, Mcleod, Pulaski, etc. \n *Note: the above projects are in support of fire mitigation and fuels reduction; this crew will not participate in prescribed or wildland fire. \n Crew Life:  \nSECC crews consist of 4-6 crew members and 2 crew leaders who provide project expertise, mentorship, training, and support to ensure the success of all participants.

Most dietary restrictions can be accommodated if communicated in advance. Crew members must be prepared to camp, travel, complete service projects, and share meals as a team. No drug or alcohol consumption is allowed during service-related activities or travel at any time.  \n Crew members will need to supply their own personal equipment such as a day pack, work pants, hiking/work boots, etc. SECC will provide tools, protective gear and transportation between SECC office and project sites. SECC has a limited supply of loaner gear available for crew members to borrow. While this gear can be helpful, we strongly recommend that members bring as much of their own gear as possible, as the loaner equipment may not fully meet personal preferences or specific needs. \n SECC supports a culture of feedback and growth. Crew Members will set goals at the beginning of the season and review their performance through both self-evaluation and a review with their Crew Leader in the middle and at the end of their season. Evaluations will cover areas such as professionalism, responsibility and leadership, communication, engagement, productivity, safety, and equipment use. Crew Members will also be asked to evaluate their Crew Leaders’ performance, the overall program, and their experience at the end of their term.  \n   Hitch Schedule:  \nThis position will operate on a variable “hitch” schedule, but generally it will follow 9 days on and 5 days off for camping crews. Project days follow a 10-hour shift with scheduled time for breaks. While the staff at SECC strive to provide consistency throughout the season, personal flexibility is expected and should be prepared for when entering the term as schedules, times, and project locations are subject to change per project needs. Applicants should be prepared to camp during hitches for the duration of the season, with lodging provided on a case-by-case basis if necessary.  \n  Requirements:  \n Minimum Qualifications:  \nMust be between ages 18 and 30, and up to 35 if a military veteran.  \nMust be a US Citizen or Permanent Resident and provide primary documentation to support this  \nMust be cleared through an acceptable check of the National Sex Offender Public Registry, as well as state and federal Criminal History Checks  \nMust have a high school diploma, GED, or agree to work toward attaining either during term of service (this is essential to obtaining and using the AmeriCorps Education Award)  \nUSFS recognized Chainsaw A feller \n  Preferred Qualifications:  \nGeneral comfort with and prior experience in outdoor environments.  \n Our Commitment: \nConservation Legacy is committed to the full inclusion of all qualified individuals and will ensure that persons with disabilities are provided reasonable accommodations to perform essential functions.

This project will leverage abundant state agency data sources to inform APM practices in north-temperate lakes.  The candidate will be supervised by Dr. Zach Feiner and Dr. Katie Hein, joining a vibrant research community at the CFL and interacting with a broad team of state and local collaborators.  \n\nSuccessful candidates will work with WDNR partners to develop and harmonize statewide APM data with existing information on aquatic plant community surveys.  This database will then be used to investigate APM effects on plant communities, including the short- and long-term effects of APM treatment regimes on the prevalence of high-importance invasive species, as well as effects on native plant diversity, community composition, and health.  This postdoc will also have the opportunity to interface with local resource managers from across the Upper Midwest on regional APM questions, as well as develop publicly available outreach and data visualization platforms (i.e., R shiny apps, online modules).  \n\nRequirements: Successful applicants will have a PhD (or will have graduated before they begin this project) in community or aquatic ecology, limnology, or a related field.  Candidates will be highly motivated and able to work independently and as part of a team, and have demonstrated skills in database management, quantitative analysis, proficiency in oral and written communication, and a strong track record of publication in peer-reviewed journals.

Understanding how these young forest stands contribute as stopover habitat for migrating songbirds is of critical importance. This project provides a unique opportunity to evaluate use of regenerating forest stands by migrating songbirds in a large and patchily disturbed landscape. The student will determine occupancy and abundance using mist-nets and using Autonomous Recording Units (ARUs). The student will use pre-existing models to identify study areas. This research is in collaboration with National Council for Air and Stream Improvement, Inc., National Alliance of Forest Owners, and Weyerhaeuser Company under the auspices of the Wildlife Conservation Initiative, and Cornell University. \n\nThe student will be working towards an MS in Wildlife and Fisheries Resources at West Virginia University. STARTING DATE: August 2025. The ideal applicant must be able to identify central Appalachian avian species by sight and sound and have extensive experience with mist-netting and handling birds. Applicants should also be familiar with collecting measurements of forest structure, including but not limited to: DBH, canopy cover (using spherical densiometers), Robel pole, Daubenmire frame, etc. Preference will be given to applicants with experience in R statistical packages, GIS, and song file analysis via RavenPro or similar software. Applicants should be comfortable working long days in the field during spring and fall months, ready to travel, and energetic and excited about applied avian conservation research on private working forests. Applicants will also be responsible for hiring and supervising a research technician to assist with research duties. Applicants must have completed a BS in Wildlife Biology, Ecology, or a closely related field. A minimum of 300 combined GRE score (V+Q) or 1100 on the previous scale, and a minimum 3.25 GPA are considered competitive. \n\nTuition waiver is included.\n\nTo Apply: Electronic applications are preferred. To apply send a single file including: 1) a cover letter outlining any relevant mist-netting and bird handling experience, 2) resumé including an unofficial copy of transcripts and GRE scores, and 3) contact information for 3 references to Dr. Chris Lituma; cml0017@mail.wvu.edu\nContact\nChristopher Lituma\n3042937473\ncml0017@mail.wvu.edu (preferred contact method)",

The GLOBE research group, led by Vojtěch Kubelka from Department of Zoology and Centre for Polar Ecology at the Faculty of Sciences, University of South Bohemia in the Czech republic, has been recently awarded a prestigious ERC CZ grant: Animal migrations in a changing world – still advantageous strategy or maladaptive behaviour? for five years till 2029.\n\n\nAnimal migrations represent one of the greatest spectacles in nature, providing crucial ecosystem services as well as resources for human communities. Why do animals migrate? It has been thought that animals migrate to reproduce at higher latitudes, taking advantage of lower predation pressure, fewer parasites and seasonally high pulses in food supply. However, it has been highlighted that recent climate change and human pressure impacts can erode such benefits and migratory animals are declining globally with poorly understood underlying mechanisms.\n\n\nWe strive to tackle pressing issues: Are there still latitudinal gradients in predation, parasitism and seasonal food availability, supporting the benefits of migratory behaviour? How are migratory animals able to cope with environmental changes? What are the most important drivers and life stages limiting populations of migratory animals? To achieve this, we are executing comprehensive research of migration profitability, combining experimental, observational and comparative approaches – investigating latitudinal gradients in predation, parasites, food supply and whole life-cycles of tracked shorebirds, a suitable model taxon with intra-specific variability in migratory strategies and exposed ground nests – at 16 study sites from the Arctic to Patagonia.\n\n\nWe seek to appoint an early career scientist as post-doctoral researcher to contribute to this new project.\n\n\nWhat would be your main responsibilities\n\nOrganize and conduct ornithological field work at selected study sites across Western Palearctic and South America in association with international collaborators\nCombine experimental and observational fieldwork with a comparative approach based on extracting relevant information from published literature\nCoordinate data collection and analyses, working with large datasets in relational databases\nPrepare and write manuscripts for publication in peer-reviewed journals\nLead or participate in funding applications for research in collaboration with team members\nSupervise students and research assistants\nParticipate in conservation activities\nPresent and promote the results at conferences and seminars\nDisseminate the project outputs to stakeholders and public,\nCarry out other scientific and/or academic activities that are important for the success of the project\n\nWhat we offer\n\nA two-year position with the possibility of extension based on the performance\nExcellent instruments, equipment and multiple research platforms within the Faculty of Sciences, University of South Bohemia in České Budějovice, Czech Republic\nAccess to the Czech Arctic research station at Svalbard and fieldwork at study sites along latitudinal gradients from Morocco to Arctic and from tropical South America to Patagonia\nExtensive international networking and mentoring opportunities\nFull logistical support for own follow-up research funding applications\nEnglish speaking, stimulating & friendly international research environment\nHR Award certificate, jcu.cz/about-the-university/development/hr-award-hrs4r\nProfessional administration support and assistance with all personal, economic, legal, project, IT, intellectual property needs, flexible working time\nCompetitive salary + possible bonuses, 5 weeks of paid vacation per year\nMeals allowance, special mobile services, university kindergarten\nWork-life balance in a historical middle-sized university city, cz/en/\n\nCompetitive candidates are expected to have\n\nPhD in evolutionary biology, behavioural ecology, zoology, or relevant field of life sciences\nA foundation of knowledge in two or more fields: evolutionary ecology, climate change biology, demography and population dynamics, predator-prey interactions and animal migration\nExperience in conducting or supervising international research projects\n3+ years hands-on experience in field research, with preference for experience with fieldwork in tropical or Arctic locations\nOrnithological fieldwork experience including bird handling and ringing (bird ringing licence is welcomed but not necessary)\nGood skills in statistical modelling, advanced level in using R\nStrong record of success conducting research and scholarly activities, including publications in peer-reviewed journals\nExperience working with analysis and presentation of large data sets\nDemonstrated project management experience and leadership skills\nBudgetary and general administrative skills\nExcellent interpersonal skills and ability to collaborate within a team-based environment, ability to work effectively both in a team and independently\nValid driving licence\n\n\nLocation description \n\nCeske Budejovice is a vibrant medium-sized city and centre of South Bohemian region with an international university community.

The opportunity may be remote.\n\nAt the heart of the USDA Forest Service's mission is their purpose. Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency’s mission and motivates their work across the agency. It’s been there from the agency’s very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the USDA Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.\n\nThe mission of the United States Forest Service (USFS) Southern Research Station (SRS) is to create science and technology needed to sustain and enhance forest ecosystems and the benefits they provide. The Center for Economics and Social Science (CESS), located within USFS-SRS, includes the Forest Economics and Policy Unit (RWU-4804). The research mission of the unit is to advance the science between natural and human-caused disturbances and economic values, and how those disturbances can be managed to reduce undesired impacts on society and ecosystems.\n\nResearch Project: The Forest Economic and Policy Unit is seeking an ORISE participant to help quantify the economic effectiveness of wildfire prevention programs (and their associated “activities”) at reducing human-caused wildfires on Tribal lands in the United States. The purpose of this experience will be to quantify temporal and spatial effects of fire prevention programs on human ignitions by including individual management practices from a time series dataset. We expect that the participant will use econometric methods to approach this research objective.\n\nLearning Objectives: The ORISE participant will learn about relevant fire prevention programs, fire prevention activities, and associated datasets. In addition, the participant will receive guidance with novel econometric techniques, and receive support with scientific writing.\n\nThe participant will have the opportunity to collaborate and receive mentorship from scientists and mangers in USFS and Bureau of Indian Affairs. The participant will develop scientific writing and econometric skills, as well as increase proficiency using statistical software (such as STATA or R). The mentor will encourage dissemination of results among managers and research groups.  \n\nMentor: The mentor for this opportunity is Sonia Bruck (sonia.bruck@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor.\n\nAnticipated Appointment Start Date: August 2025.  Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.\n\nAppointment Length: The appointment will initially be until December 30, 2025, but may be extended upon recommendation of USDA Forest Service and is contingent on the availability of funds.\n\nLevel of Participation: The appointment is part time.\n\nParticipant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend range is $3,000-$3,500 per month.\n\nCitizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents (LPR), and foreign nationals. Non-U.S. citizen applicants should refer to the Guidelines for Non-U.S. Citizens Details page of the program website for information about the valid immigration statuses that are acceptable for program participation. Foreign national candidates may have a mandatory in-person requirement depending on visa status.\n\nORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and USDA Forest Service. Participants do not become employees of USDA, USDA Forest Service, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits. Proof of health insurance is required for participation in this program. Health insurance can be obtained through ORISE.\n\nQuestions: Please visit our Program Website. After reading, if you have additional questions about the application process please email ORISE.USFS.SRS@orau.org and include the reference code for this opportunity.\n\nQualifications\nThe qualified candidate should be currently pursuing or have received a master's or postdoctoral degree in the one of the relevant fields (Forestry Economics or Applied Economics). Degree must have been received or be currently pursuing by the start date.\n\nPreferred skills:\n\nExperience with econometric methods, and some knowledge in forestry or wildland fire science.\n  Contact\nUSDA-USFS-SRS-2025-0067\ncontact via the web posting is preferred (see Details section)",

The position is unpaid, but stipends are available to cover expenses and to reward accomplishments. The Bear Conservation Specialist (Teton Country) will rapidly gain valuable professional experience by playing an integral role on the WRF team. Work to build WRF’s bear conservation capacity and impact on Teton National Park bears as you contribute and strengthen your conservation knowledge and skills. Gain recognition for your efforts among area partners, on the WRF website, and elsewhere, as you participate in meeting WRF’s mission, which is to increase park wildlife population viability both ex situ and in situ, working closely with National Parks and Forests, zoo partners, and park gateway communities.\n\n\nWRF operates effectively and efficiently and generates resources that enable measurable, boots-on-the-ground conservation results. The WRF Bear Conservation Specialist (Teton Country) will focus on implementation of the “I Am Bear Safe” Project in small towns neighboring Teton National Park’s gateway communities in Montana. The Bear Conservation Specialist (Teton Country) will collaborate with the WRF President, Director of Communications, and other team members in connection to the “I Am Bear Safe” Project.\n\n\n [https://www.wildlifeandparks.org/projects].\n\n\n“I Am Bear Safe”™ (IABS) is a multi-partner Wildlife Coexistence Strategy designed to equip National Park gateway community chambers of commerce and their member businesses (“Park Gateway Partners”) to “train people not to train bears” to get in the trouble they are in now because of human behavior—a situation that is assuring bear demise. Bears are a top attraction at many National Parks and are well-managed within the parks to avoid human interaction. But communities at the park’s edge are not sufficiently prepared or equipped for the increasing pressure of more visitors coupled with rapid development, naïve new residents, and a growing number of recreationists in bear country. Park Gateway Partner (PGP) businesses are the perfect intervention point and receive marketing benefits from participating in the IABS town-based bear stewardship effort. WRF provides customized tools (signage and SWAG) that equip PGPs to effectively intercept park visitors and recreationists and equip them to be bear stewards who act responsibly by securing attractants and following park rules for recreating in bear habitat. The IABS goal is that bears perform their natural behaviors and survive without risk and distraction caused by humans.\n\n\nResponsibilities:\n\nTrack the inventory of IABS materials distributed to PGPs in each town.\nDistribute IABS Toolkit materials to PGPs and redistribution points.\nRecruit new PGPs, as appropriate and assigned.\nField questions and relay PGP concerns to WRF.\nAttend meetings of the chamber of commerce or local partner organization on occasion.\nMail out reward IABS reward magnets to Bear Quiz-takers.\nCome up with novel ideas to make the IABS Project more effective.\n\nEducation & Experience\n\nBachelor’s degree in a relevant subject is required; graduate degree helpful.\nKnowledge and experience specific to grizzly and black bears required.\nExperience working with community-based organizations and/or local businesses.\n\nWRF Bear Conservation Specialists are asked to participate in an initial training then designate 16 hours a week to WRF and agree to work with WRF for 4 months. The Bear Conservation Specialist (Teton Country) Should be a self-starter, ambitious, creative, productive, and dedicated to WRF’s mission. S/he must also exhibit a high degree of professionalism, accountability, and ability to follow instructions and manage time well. S/he should be friendly and approachable, well-spoken, bold, and personable.  The internship is unpaid, but stipends are provided for approved expenses and as results are achieved. \n\n\nThe Bear Conservation Specialist (Teton Country) will report to Julie Anton Randall, WRF President. Hours are flexible within the week, with the exception that PGP deliveries and communications best occur during business hours. Participation in biweekly IABS team meetings and occasional full WRF team meetings by Zoom are required.\n\nPlease send a short (less than one page) cover letter and resume with references to wildliferestorationvolunteer@gmail.com.  Please name the electronic file as follows: [Date]_BCS-Teton-Country_[Your Name].\n\nThank you for your dedication to bears and excitement about being part of the Wildlife Restoration Foundation team in Teton Country!\n\n\n\nContact\nOlivia Kramer\ninfo@wildlifeandparks.org (preferred contact method)",

We wield the power of law and the strength of partnership to protect people’s health; preserve magnificent places and wildlife; advance clean energy; and combat climate change. We partner with thousands of groups and supporters to take on the biggest, most precedent-setting cases across the country and have a distinguished track record of achieving significant, lasting environmental protections. We are here because the earth needs a good lawyer.\n\n\nEarthjustice’s work is currently divided into three major areas:\n\nLands, Wildlife, and Oceans focuses on cases that protect endangered species, national forests, national parks, other public lands, water resources, and the oceans.\nHealthy Communities focuses on cases that protect public health, prevent air and water pollution, and curb exposures to toxic chemicals, particularly in disproportionately impacted communities. Recently, our healthy communities work has also begun to promote sustainable food and agriculture and the rights of farm workers.\nClimate and Energy focuses on cases that encourage the swift and just transition to clean energy while challenging the reliance on coal, oil, and other dirty fuels.\n\nWe welcome all interested law students from across the country to apply for a summer law clerk position.

The total stipend amount will be dependent on any external funding a student secures, such as through their law school’s summer funding program. Earthjustice will provide a one-time stipend at the start of the clerkship in the amount of $1,320.00 per week, minus the total amount received from any other sources and applicable taxes. The summer law clerkship is designed to be 10 weeks long at full-time hours (37.5 hours/week).\n\n\nYou are welcome to pursue outside funding.

The crew will be based out of the SCC Durango office. The crew will collect seeds from native species in remote areas on DOI land following SOS protocols.  Crews will be required to drive to different areas throughout Colorado, camp overnight, potentially hike several miles a day, and return to the office for equipment and data management. This position requires significant driving relative to other types of field work. Crew leaders must be prepared for long days of driving and scouting from a truck. This position also requires the ability to maintain focus during highly repetitive and meticulous work. Safety is a pre-requisite, particularly where industry development (energy extraction, e.g. natural gas) is occurring and during hunting season. Risk management will guide how fieldwork is conducted. The crew leader will be responsible for adhering to check-out/check-in procedures and communications via inReach device to ensure crew safety.     \n\nSeed collected by DOI is saved in short- and long- term storage to support development of plant materials for land restoration purposes by DOI and other entities. The crew leader will oversee and be accountable for successful data management, including record filing, database input, and seed processing in order to preserve plant species for future generations. \n Specific duties will include selecting and locating populations of plant species based on the established SOS Protocol, and locally developed target species lists. The crew leader will oversee fieldwork and work with crew members to locate populations of targeted species, monitor phenology of the population, collect botanical voucher specimens, assess seed quantity and quality prior to seed collection, collect seed, record site data, prepare documentation, and ship collected seed for cleaning and short-term storage. The ability to identify plants both in the field and in the office via dichotomous keys is an important function of the position. However, help with plant ID will be provided, and IDs will be reviewed. The crew leader will use ArcGIS tablet applications (i.e. ArcCollector) software to locate and document collections. Use of 4-wheel drive vehicles in rugged off-road situations is expected. Familiarity with this equipment is highly desirable, but training will be provided where needed.   \n\n While Seeds of Success is the primary focus, the crew may also assist with other conservation program projects during the season to promote additional education and experience. \n This position requires patience, a consistently positive mental attitude, mentorship, technical aptitude, focus on efficiency, and a high level of competence in the outdoors. It also involves an administration role, where weekly paperwork is due in a timely manner to supervisors. Finally, crew leaders must exhibit the ability to effectively work on diverse teams and those from a variety of populations and communities. \n Housing: Crews are responsible for their own housing, transportation, and food between camping trips. For the most part, housing is not provided. We are glad to talk through your options with you in the interview and onward.  \n Training: The term begins with leadership training which focuses on developing outdoor leadership skills, goal setting, technical and field skills training and developing an understanding of SCC policies. Following leadership training, crew leaders will attend a SOS protocol training with the Bureau of Land Management. Informal hands-on training will continue throughout the term with on-the-ground skills training. The crew leader will help train the crew members and contribute to a regional seed collection training. Depending on the project needs, crews may receive specialized training.  \n\nSchedule: Season will start with two weeks of training, 5 days on, 2 days off. Once in the field, hitch schedule will vary based on need with switching from 4 days on, 3 days off to 8 days on, 6 days off. Applicants should expect the project schedule to vary and to have nontraditional work hours including weekends and evening hours. Workdays will start with stretch and safety where crews warm up and review any safety risks for the day.  Days include two 15-minute breaks and one 30-minute lunch. On-hitch, crews camp together, prepare all meals together, and work together as a group to complete all projects and chores.  \n\nGear: Participants must supply their own personal outdoor gear and equipment such as a tent, sleeping bag, sleeping pad, day pack, work pants, hiking/work boots, etc. A suggested gear-list will be provided prior to starting the term of service.

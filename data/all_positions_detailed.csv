Description
The Montana Master Naturalist Program is designed for people who want to stoke their curiosity, deepen their knowledge of the natural world, and give back to their communities in new ways. We hope that participants will not only build the skills to interpret Montana’s flora, fauna, and landscape, but that they will also gain a deeper understanding and appreciation for the natural world, and therefore become better stewards of it. This program is an excellent certification for those looking to pursue a career in environmental education or interpretive guiding, or those just looking to enhance their connection to place. During six days of experiential, field-based education, participants learn to identify species, interpret behaviors, and affirm ecological relationships. This foundational, applied knowledge not only enriches a sense of place, but also builds the confidence, attention, and curiosity to respect and conserve diverse ecosystems.

Description
The Integrative Wildlife Conservation lab at Trent University, Ontario, Canada, in collaboration with the Lithops Research and Conservation Foundation, is offering a unique PhD project on the eco-evolutionary and conservation dynamics of Lithops spp., a genus of small succulent plants occurring in isolated colonies across desert landscapes in southern Africa. In the wild, Lithops are susceptible to human collection, habitat loss, and climate change, with many populations and species currently subject to high extinction risk. There are important knowledge gaps related to Lithops phylogeny and ecology that are currently impacting rigorous conservation status assessment and protection. Trent University is among only a handful of facilities worldwide housing Lithops plants and seeds originating from wild colonies, providing a truly unique opportunity to address integrative questions related to evolution, population genetics, and conservation biology in a controlled, rigorous and impactful context. The PhD project may include investigations related to genome sequencing, phylogenetics, evolutionary divergence, and linkage analysis, and adaptation to harsh environmental conditions, and the candidate will have the opportunity to develop specific research questions based on their interest and expertise. 

 Successful candidates MUST have an MSc in Biology, Genetics, Conservation, or related field, demonstrated evidence of peer-reviewed publications, strong lab and field skills, and an interest in working collaboratively within a large and diverse research group. Additional desirable qualifications include DNA sequencing, bioinformatics and GIS skills.  
 To apply, send a cover letter, curriculum vitae, unofficial academic transcript, and contact information for 3 references to: Dennis Murray (dennismurray@trentu.ca).

Description
Fully funded MSc and PhD positions with Dr. April Martinig at the Université de Sherbrooke

Start date: May 2026 or September 2026 (negotiable)

The pay: minimum $20,000 per year for 2 years for MSc and $25,000 per year for 4 years for PhD. In Quebec, tuition fees vary depending on your province or country of residence (net salary will be adjusted to cover tuition). Tuition waivers are available for international students. 

Students can tailor their research across three themes:

Tracking in the wild: Work with long-term datasets on red squirrels in the Yukon, exploring the demographic consequences of behaviour and movement. This project will involve fully subsidized fieldwork and collaboration with an interdisciplinary research team.
Meta-analyses: You will have the opportunity to conduct large-scale syntheses on a topic of your choice - from dispersal and behaviour to climate resilience, conservation interventions, or any other ecological or evolutionary theme that sparks curiosity. This project is ideal for those who enjoy identifying patterns across studies, asking big-picture questions, and working with data across systems.
Big data: Use cutting-edge movement datasets from global wildlife tracking networks (over 14 billion locations from 1,500+ species) to develop predictive models of animal responses to environmental change. Students will build skills in R, spatial analysis, and ecological modelling.

Minimum qualifications: BSc and research experience in biology (e.g., ecology, evolution, or environmental sciences), statistics, math, computer science, natural resources, or related fields. Applicants must be admissible to the Biology Department for a masters degree (minimum 3.0/4.3 GPA) or doctoral degree (completed MSc OR 4.0/4.3 BSc GPA). Knowledge of French is not mandatory (e.g., English theses are permitted). 

Competitive applicants will also have:  
🧠 Experience working with data in R, Python, or other coding languages 
✍️ Practice communicating science–whether through papers, blogs, posters, or presentations

Description
I am seeking a Masters student interested in pollinator ecology. We will be examining how pollinator diversity, abundance, and floral resource use change in response to wetland restorations. In collaboration with partner agencies and private landowners, we will monitor pollinator diversity and floral resource use as outlined in the National Protocol Framework for The Inventory and Monitoring of Bees and the Integrated Monarch Monitoring Program. Aerial netting and passive trapping methods will allow us to monitor for a large variety of invertebrate pollinators. Oregon has an extremely high diversity of invertebrate pollinators with over 650 documented bee species and 150 butterfly species. This research will enable effective land management practices from various restoration choices faced by land management agencies in the eastern Cascade ecoregion. 
 Prospective students interested in pollinator ecology are encouraged to apply.  The student will be paid as a teaching assistant with a $10,000 a year stipend and $7,000 in tuition remission. Applicants should have: a degree in ecology, entomology, biology or related discipline and experience in data analysis using GIS and/or R. Field experience is highly preferred. Applicants must have excellent English writing and verbal communication skills, as well as the ability to work with and lead a research team.

 Application Process:
Applications due on a rolling basis, with the position closing on July 31st.  Position would start September 2025.

Description
Antioch University is offering work study positions, if you enroll in the Environmental Studies Master’s program, and is accepting applications to start your MS degree during the fall semester (late August) of 2025. MS Concentrations include Conservation Biology, Environmental Education, Advocacy for Social Justice and Sustainability, and several others. In Conservation Biology, students focus on gaining quantitative (GIS and statistics), writing, and ecological field skills. Students also gain experience with community engagement, social justice, and applied research and service.

Students often work with Antioch faculty in our existing research programs. Specifically in our Conservation Biology concentration, we have expertise in vertebrate ecology (e.g., birds, snakes), invertebrate ecology (e.g., estuarine invertebrates, insects), tropical ecology, forest ecology, alpine ecology, marine ecology, and coastal restoration. In some cases, faculty may have extramural funding to support students in seasonal field and lab positions, including research in New England and in the Caribbean. Students who are eligible for US federal work-study can work part time in various on-campus work-study positions, including Graduate Teaching and Research Assistantships and various positions in our numerous campus centers (e.g., Institute for International Conservation, Spatial Analysis Lab). However, you need to be accepted and taking classes as a graduate student to be eligible for these work-study positions. Students at Antioch generally pay for at least part of their own tuition, but we offer numerous university-wide grants and scholarships, which can help defray tuition costs, and which are detailed here: https://www.antioch.edu/admission-aid/financial-aid/scholarships-and-grants/ . We also work with students to help them apply for external scholarships, fellowships, and research-focused grants.

Students can earn their graduate degree with either face-to-face classes at the Antioch University New England campus in Keene, NH, USA, or fully online classes (that can be taken from anywhere) which are offered each semester, or with a mixture of the two. Ecological field trip classes (intensive 1-2 week trips to destinations abroad and in-country) are also available for all students. All classes are just 1-2 days a week, making this a viable program for environmental professionals working part or full-time. Our programs are student-centered, flexible, and tailored to meet your individual needs, learning style, and location.

Join our tight-knit community as we strive to advance social and environmental justice, conserve biodiversity, and mitigate climate change as a department and as a university! For more information about our programs, visit our webpages (https://www.antioch.edu/academics/program-finder?_sft_focus=environmental-studies-sustainability ,  https://www.antioch.edu/academics/environmental-studies-sustainability/environmental-studies-ms/conservation-biology-es-ms/ ) or contact Melissa Baptiste, Admissions Counselor, at mbaptiste (at) antioch.edu.

Project Title: The Spatial-Temporal Activities, Habitat Selection, and Diet of the Understudied, Species of Greatest Conservation Need, the Western Massasauga Rattlesnake (Sistrurus tergeminus).
 Start Date: Preferred M.S. enrollment beginning in January 2026.
 Description: I am seeking TWO highly motivated M.S. students interested in herpetology, spatial ecology, and behavioral ecology to work on a field project involving Western Massasauga Rattlesnakes (Sistrurus tergeminus). These positions will be advised by Dr. Dylan Maag in the Department of Life, Earth, and Environmental Sciences at WTAMU. This project will be a highly collaborative effort requiring both graduate assistants to work simultaneously and with summer field technicians on all aspects of field data collection. Students will then focus separately on the analysis of spatial ecology and hunting behavior/diet, while working together on habitat selection for their theses, manuscripts, and project reports.
 S. tergeminus is currently a Species of Greatest Conservation Need in Texas and is native to Texas grasslands (one of the most endangered habitats in TX). This project is funded by the Texas Office of the Comptroller through their Endangered Species Management Research. Students will use a combination of mark-recapture, radiotelemetry, animal-borne accelerometry, field videography, habitat sampling, and diet analysis in the field starting in late spring 2026 to early fall 2028 to achieve the following objectives: 1) Obtain basic demographic statistics for the population of S. tergeminus. 2) Estimate the spatial ecology of adult S. tergeminus. 3) Quantify diel and seasonal activity, and species-typical behaviors of adult snakes. 4) Model S. tergeminus habitat selection at multiple scales. 5) Measure critical spatial, temporal, selection, and social variables associated with overwintering. 6) Estimate and measure the snakes’ diets and hunting behaviors.
 Prospective students should be comfortable working alone and in teams in the field and will be expected to mentor research technicians and undergraduate volunteers throughout the project. Students should also be comfortable with being trained to safety handle venomous snakes with the goal of them handling the snakes themselves. Students should also expect to regularly interact with both TX state biologists and managers, and private landowners throughout the project.
 Qualifications: B.S. in Biology, Wildlife Biology, Zoology, or a related field is required. Students must meet the qualifications of WTAMU’s graduate program for MS, Biology, https://www.wtamu.edu/academics/college-agriculture-natural-sciences/department-life-earth-environmental-sciences/programs/graduate/biology-graduate-program.html (3.0 GPA in all undergraduate related science courses, etc.). Students must also possess a valid Driver’s License. Experience handling venomous snakes is NOT required but is preferred. Students must be willing to be trained to safely handle venomous snakes and demonstrate proficiency in doing so. Experience working within the R coding language, GIS programs, and radiotelemetry are preferred but not required. Lastly, this project is set to last for 38 months thus, students must be prepared to devote 2.5–3 years towards this project and their MS degree at WTAMU.
 Compensation: These are fully funded graduate research assistant positions (i.e., no teaching) that comes with a stipend of $26,159–27,794 per year for 6 consecutive semesters, starting in Spring 2026. WTAMU graduate assistants also qualify for a partial tuition waiver and medical insurance coverage. For more information please visit WTAMU’s LEES department webpage, https://www.wtamu.edu/academics/college-agriculture-natural-sciences/department-life-earth-environmental-sciences/index.html, and WTAMU’s Graduate School webpage, https://www.wtamu.edu/academics/graduate-school/index.html. 
 How to Apply: Interested applicants should submit a single PDF document, which includes the following: 1) A letter of interest. 2) CV. 3) A copy of unofficial transcripts. 4) Contact information for three academic/professional references.

dmaag@wtamu.edu (preferred contact method)","Project Title: The Spatial-Temporal Activities, Habitat Selection, and Diet of the Understudied, Species of Greatest Conservation Need, the Western Massasauga Rattlesnake (Sistrurus tergeminus).
 Start Date: Preferred M.S. enrollment beginning in January 2026.
 Description: I am seeking TWO highly motivated M.S. students interested in herpetology, spatial ecology, and behavioral ecology to work on a field project involving Western Massasauga Rattlesnakes (Sistrurus tergeminus). These positions will be advised by Dr. Dylan Maag in the Department of Life, Earth, and Environmental Sciences at WTAMU. This project will be a highly collaborative effort requiring both graduate assistants to work simultaneously and with summer field technicians on all aspects of field data collection. Students will then focus separately on the analysis of spatial ecology and hunting behavior/diet, while working together on habitat selection for their theses, manuscripts, and project reports.
 S. tergeminus is currently a Species of Greatest Conservation Need in Texas and is native to Texas grasslands (one of the most endangered habitats in TX). This project is funded by the Texas Office of the Comptroller through their Endangered Species Management Research. Students will use a combination of mark-recapture, radiotelemetry, animal-borne accelerometry, field videography, habitat sampling, and diet analysis in the field starting in late spring 2026 to early fall 2028 to achieve the following objectives: 1) Obtain basic demographic statistics for the population of S. tergeminus. 2) Estimate the spatial ecology of adult S. tergeminus. 3) Quantify diel and seasonal activity, and species-typical behaviors of adult snakes. 4) Model S. tergeminus habitat selection at multiple scales. 5) Measure critical spatial, temporal, selection, and social variables associated with overwintering. 6) Estimate and measure the snakes’ diets and hunting behaviors.
 Prospective students should be comfortable working alone and in teams in the field and will be expected to mentor research technicians and undergraduate volunteers throughout the project. Students should also be comfortable with being trained to safety handle venomous snakes with the goal of them handling the snakes themselves. Students should also expect to regularly interact with both TX state biologists and managers, and private landowners throughout the project.
 Qualifications: B.S. in Biology, Wildlife Biology, Zoology, or a related field is required. Students must meet the qualifications of WTAMU’s graduate program for MS, Biology, https://www.wtamu.edu/academics/college-agriculture-natural-sciences/department-life-earth-environmental-sciences/programs/graduate/biology-graduate-program.html (3.0 GPA in all undergraduate related science courses, etc.). Students must also possess a valid Driver’s License. Experience handling venomous snakes is NOT required but is preferred. Students must be willing to be trained to safely handle venomous snakes and demonstrate proficiency in doing so. Experience working within the R coding language, GIS programs, and radiotelemetry are preferred but not required. Lastly, this project is set to last for 38 months thus, students must be prepared to devote 2.5–3 years towards this project and their MS degree at WTAMU.
 Compensation: These are fully funded graduate research assistant positions (i.e., no teaching) that comes with a stipend of $26,159–27,794 per year for 6 consecutive semesters, starting in Spring 2026. WTAMU graduate assistants also qualify for a partial tuition waiver and medical insurance coverage. For more information please visit WTAMU’s LEES department webpage, https://www.wtamu.edu/academics/college-agriculture-natural-sciences/department-life-earth-environmental-sciences/index.html, and WTAMU’s Graduate School webpage, https://www.wtamu.edu/academics/graduate-school/index.html. 
 How to Apply: Interested applicants should submit a single PDF document, which includes the following: 1) A letter of interest. 2) CV. 3) A copy of unofficial transcripts. 4) Contact information for three academic/professional references. Applications should be sent to Dr. Dylan Maag at dmaag@wtamu.edu and include “M.S. MASSASAUGA APPLICATION” in the subject line.

Description
 The James C. Kennedy Waterfowl and Wetlands Conservation Center at Clemson University is seeking a highly motivated Ph.D. or M.S. candidate to conduct research on materials for tidal trunks and other water control structures with the goal of developing alternative, cost-effective solutions for water level management in waterfowl impoundments in coastal South Carolina. 
 Water control structures are critical for effective wetland management. Historically, wooden tidal trunks had a life span of 25–30 years, but the discontinuation of chromate copper arsenate and creosote-treated lumber has reduced this to 8–10 years due to the use of pressure-treated lumber with alkaline copper quaternary preservatives. These trunks lose tensile strength from cyclic wetting and drying, salt crystal formation, decomposition, and insect colonization, with replacement costs reaching $20,000 to $25,000 each. Research is required to evaluate new materials and designs for tidal trunks while considering traditional design significance. The objectives of this study are to 1) inventory the number and characteristics of tidal trunks and other water control structures in South Carolina's coastal counties, 2) interview land managers and owners to evaluate critical and desirable design features of tidal trunks, 3) conduct a comprehensive literature review evaluating potential materials and designs, 4) document wildlife and invertebrate use of tidal trunks, 5) evaluate material performance, and 6) work with experienced tidal trunk builders to design, build, and install new prototypes.  
 The student will be working toward a graduate degree in Forest Resources, Biosystems Engineering, Environmental Engineering and Earth Sciences, or Civil Engineering at Clemson University. Clemson University (http://www.clemson.edu/about/) is a public land-grant Carnegie R1 Research University in a college town atmosphere on Lake Hartwell within view of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Students will take classes on the main campus and conduct fieldwork along South Carolina's coast at the Tom Yawkey Wildlife Center, the Baruch Institute of Coastal Ecology and Forest Science, located on the 16,000-acre Hobcaw Barony property, and other coastal locations. 
 The student will be advised by a multidisciplinary team comprised of Dr. Christophe Darnault (Environmental Engineering and Earth Sciences), Dr. Brunela Rodrigues (Wood Utilization and Biomaterials), Dr. Michael Stoner (Civil Engineering), and Dr. Jim Anderson (James C. Kennedy Waterfowl and Wetlands Conservation Center).  

QUALIFICATIONS: B.S. (for M.S.) and M.S. (for Ph.D.) in Environmental or Civil Engineering, Materials Science, Wood Science, Forest Engineering, Environmental Science, or a closely related field. Minimum undergraduate GPA of 3.00. A strong interest and experience in engineering design, material science, and design software is crucial. Interest in environmental sustainability, historic preservation, wetlands, statistics, and publishing is a plus. A valid driver’s license and reliable transportation is required. Due to current visa restrictions imposed by the United States government, you must be a United States citizen to apply for this position. 
 Clemson University does not discriminate based on race, color, religion, sexual orientation, gender, pregnancy, national origin, age, or disability. We encourage applications from minorities, women, veterans, and all other qualified applicants. 
 STIPEND: $25,000 (Ph.D.) or $22,000 (M.S.) plus tuition waiver. 
 CONTACT: Interested individuals should email a letter of interest, resume, a <1,000-word statement of purpose (why do you want to work on this project, your research interests, and long-term career goals), unofficial copy of transcripts, GRE/TOEFL scores (if available), proof of valid drivers license, examples of published papers, and contact information for 3 references to Ms. Crystal Anderson at crhode2@clemson.edu.

Description
Three graduate research assistantships (Ph.D. (preferred) or M.S.) in aquatic ecology and harmful algal blooms are available in Alan Wilson’s lab at Auburn University (https://www.wilsonlab.com/).  We are an active and productive lab with current research projects that are funded by a variety of grants from USDA ARS, USDA NIFA, NSF Dimensions of Biodiversity, and USGS that leverage our field station that includes hundreds of aquaculture ponds and nearby recreational and drinking water reservoirs.  Here, we pursue basic and applied questions associated with understanding the ecological, evolutionary, and limnological mechanisms controlling the structure and function of freshwater plankton communities.  Harmful algal blooms are the foci for many of our projects.  My students are welcome to participate on existing projects, which include large-scale field experiments and monitoring, lab-based analytical analyses, modeling, and meta-analysis, but are strongly encouraged to develop their own projects  in addition to applying for external grants and fellowships, such as the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship program.  There are numerous opportunities to work directly with important stakeholders, such as aquaculture farmers, water utilities, and natural resource managers.

I am motivated to maintain a productive, diverse, and inclusive lab and encourage students from under-represented groups to consider joining us.  Moreover, lab members are strongly encouraged to develop outreach activities to broaden the impact of their research.

Qualifications: Ideal candidates will be data driven, hard-working, honest, highly self-motivated, team-oriented, and excited about studying freshwater communities.  Prior coursework in ecology, limnology, and statistics, a strong interest in mentoring undergraduates and participating in outreach, and relevant research experiences (including analytical skills, such molecular, GC-MS, GC-FID, HPLC, ELISA) are desirable, but not required. 

Support: Competitive graduate research assistantships (starting for Ph.D. = $35k/yr and M.S. = $30k/yr) include 12-month stipend and full tuition waivers.  Highly qualified Ph.D. candidates will be considered for an AU Presidential Graduate Research Fellowship (http://graduate.auburn.edu/au-presidential-graduate-research-fellowships/) or AU Presidential Graduate Opportunity Fellowship (http://graduate.auburn.edu/prospective-students/presidential-graduate-opportunity-program/), which can last 3 years and include an annual stipend of at least $50,000.  Moreover, all students in the lab are well supported to conduct high quality research and are strongly encouraged and supported to share their research at scientific conferences.

Start date: Flexible but Spring and Summer 2025 would be ideal considering current projects.

Description
 Call for applicants for a PhD in Fisheries, Wildlife, and Conservation Sciences 

Department of Fisheries, Wildlife and Conservation Sciences, 

Oregon State University 

 Project title: Developing multi-method approaches for landscape-scale sampling of small mammals 

 Summary: The Twining Applied Quantitative Ecology Lab at Oregon State University is seeking a highly motivated PhD student to conduct applied ecological research focused on developing field and statistical methods for statewide monitoring of small mammal populations. 
 Position description: Small mammal populations are critical to Oregon’s ecosystems, with essential roles in the regulation of plant communities, as ecosystem engineers, and as a critical prey base to many predators. Despite this, the status of most small mammal species in Oregon is uncertain. In Oregon’s State Wildlife Action Plan, several are identified as Species of Greatest Conservation Need (e.g., Western gray squirrel, red tree vole) while many others are recognized as Species of Greatest Information Need (e.g., Preble’s shrew). The most recent data we have on a state-wide scale to inform the conservation and management of small mammals in Oregon are records reported within “Land Mammals of Oregon” (Verts & Carraway, 1998). The long-term goal of this project is to update estimates of i) distribution, ii) abundance, iii) and habitat associations for a range small mammals statewide. A critical step towards this goal is developing capacity for large-scale sampling of small mammals, which requires a suite of non-invasive survey tools applicable to three key groups: i) arboreal species, e.g., Western grey squirrels, red tree voles, ii) terrestrial species e.g., Preble’s shrew, and iii) fossorial species e.g., pocket gophers. Optimal multi-method protocols will be developed through field and lab tests paired with simulations. Depending on students’ interests, there will be scope to develop research focused on any or all the key species and groups. This PhD will facilitate future statewide sampling of small mammals to inform conservation action for a range of species. 
 This PhD program will involve extensive field work in western Oregon (planning, establishing, and running field trials using a combination of invasive and non-invasive methods including capturing small mammals) as well as quantitative model development. We will develop and test a suite of non-invasive sampling methods applicable to a range of small mammals and use simulations to produce optimal multi-method sampling protocols for arboreal, terrestrial, and fossorial mammals in Oregon. The student will join a growing and supportive lab group and work closely with project partners including state agency collaborators at Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, Oregon Biodiversity Information Center, and NCASI. The student will be expected to integrate as an active collaborator and facilitate project management. They will co-develop and implement a project-related dissertation under the mentorship of their advisor, Dr. Joshua P. Twining.  
 

 
Start date: January 5th, 2026
 
 

Funding: Fully funded, including 12 months of salary (~$30-33k) and covering the costs of tuition, fees, and benefits each year. The student will be supported through a combination of graduate research assistantships and employment as a graduate teaching assistant. 
 Minimum requirements:  
•      Applicants must meet the OSU Graduate School minimum requirements for admission (found at: https://gradschool.oregonstate.edu/admissions/academic-requirements).  
•      BS in Ecology or an associated field by the expected start date. E.g., wildlife, conservation, biology, or allied fields. 
•      Strong quantitative base (e.g., statistical training, competency in R)  
•      Aptitude and enthusiasm for fieldwork under variety of conditions 
•      Strong written and oral communication skills across different types of audiences.  
•      Resilience and adaptability 
•      Ability to work both independently and collaboratively as part of a team 
 

Preferred skills and qualifications: 
•      MS in Ecology or an associated field by the expected start date. E.g., wildlife, conservation, biology, or allied fields  
•      Demonstration of an ability to take projects from planning and implementation through to completion with written products (e.g., peer reviewed publications). 
•      Trapping and handling mammals 
•      Familiarity with genetic methods (e.g., microsatellite analyses, sanger sequencing) 
•      Hierarchical modelling (e.g., occupancy modelling, spatial-recapture recapture) 
•      Experience with Bayesian inference and familiarity with relevant software 
 To apply: Please submit the following via email as a single PDF document: 

1.      Cover letter, less than 2-pages single-spaced (size 12 font) describing how you meet the minimum and preferred requirements for this role, your research interests and experiences, what you ultimately hope to do achieve within and after the PhD.  

2.      A current resume or curriculum vitae 

3.      Transcripts (unofficial copy is okay for review, but official needed if selected) 

4.      The names and contact information of three academic or professional references  
 Email your application packet to Dr. Joshua P. Twining, joshua.twining@oregonstate.edu with the email title “PhD Application – small mammals.” Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis, with priority given to applications received by July 15th. Please reach out with any questions.

Description
MICROPLASTIC POLLUTION AND ECOTOXICOLOGY - Microplastic pollution has garnered much attention in recent years, yet much is still unknown regarding the extent and threat posed by this pollutant. We will review the recent and seminal literature focusing on the distribution of plastic pollution and the negative effects on the environment. Our goal is to build a strong foundation of knowledge about this emerging field and recognize the current gaps in understanding its effects on wildlife. Although this is not a laboratory class, methods and materials on how to sample, isolate, and quantify microplastic pollution in various samples will be reviewed and demonstrated for researchers interested in collecting measurements in the field.

This is a 1-credit equivalent academic course (16 contact hrs + additional work) where you learn at your own pace over 3 months.

COURSE DESCRIPTION - Learn and/or interpret ‘multivariate’ analysis methods, which are used on datasets with multiple response variables (such as many different species, traits, habitat conditions, genomic information, etc.). This course helps you identify the ecological and statistical properties of multivariate responses, demonstrates how to summarize and graph data to reveal those properties, explains which distance measures will do the best job capturing the patterns among your responses, discusses the consequences of modifying or failing to modify data when needed, introduces the most common multivariate analyses applicable to ecological datasets, describes ordination and how to interpret ordination diagrams, and takes you through a ten-step process for performing, interpreting, and communicating defensible analyses for five different types of guided ordination: WA, PO, CCA, RDA, and FSO. This course (MECA I) is the first course in a two-part series taught in PC-ORD with many exercises in R. In MECA II, you will build upon your foundation in MECA I to cover an additional 18 free ordination, classification, group testing, association assessment, and trait analysis tools in PC-ORD.

COURSE DESCRIPTION - Species presence/absence is a fundamental concept used in many areas of ecology (e.g., species distributions, habitat modeling, monitoring, and metapopulation studies), however imperfect detection can lead to false absences. Unaccounted for false absences can lead to misleading inferences about patterns and dynamics of species occurrence and the factors that influence them. We will learn methods for accounting for imperfect detection with species detection/non-detection data and also discuss important study design considerations. Exercises are completed using Program PRESENCE and RPresence. You will have 3 months of access to course materials as you work at your own pace.

Description
COURSE DESCRIPTION - Much of statistical practice is concerned with parameter uncertainty, and ignores model uncertainty, which arises when we fit several models and find that no single model stands out as best. This course will provide you with the tools to be able to allow for both types of uncertainty. Model averaging involves estimating the parameters in a way that allows for model uncertainty, and it often provides better estimates and confidence/credible intervals than those from a single best model. The course is divided into two modules (Bayesian and Frequentist model averaging) composed of pre-recorded lecture material and hands-on exercises using R. The course is based on David Fletcher's recent book (Springer 2018), which can be found here.

COURSE DESCRIPTION - A good understanding of sampling and experimental design techniques is vital when planning a research study in ecology and wildlife management. Good design leads to effective use of research money, time and effort, whereas poor design can lead to a study of little use, and hence a waste of these resources. Sampling techniques are useful when planning an observational study, such as a survey, whereas experimental design techniques are of use when planning an experiment. In the sampling modules, we will cover random vs. systematic sampling, stratification, hierarchical sampling, use of covariates, trend analysis, and introduce specialized techniques such as capture-mark-recapture and distance sampling. In the experimental design modules, you will learn about randomization, replication and pseudo-replication, controls, blocking, use of covariates, factorial treatments, before-after control-impact (BACI) designs, and trend analysis. In both sections of the course, we will show you how to perform power/precision analysis in order to assess what sample sizes might be required for the study to provide useful information.

Description
COURSE DESCRIPTION - Bayesian methods for analyzing data are now widely used in ecology and wildlife management. The Bayesian approach involves specifying the “prior” distribution, which represents the uncertainty about the model parameters before we collect the data, and the likelihood, which represents the plausibility of different parameters values based solely on the data. These are combined via Bayes’ Rule to obtain the “posterior” distribution for the parameters, which represents the uncertainty about the parameters after we have analyzed the data. Using the Bayesian approach gives you more flexibility in the type of models that you can fit, compared to the classical frequentist approach, as the model is typically specified in the same way that you would write it down mathematically. Once you have become familiar with fitting a Bayesian model in R, you will appreciate the extra flexibility and the more intuitive way in which the results can be presented.

Description
COURSE DESCRIPTION - Our planet, including our atmosphere, forests, water, and other living entities, are fundamental to human survival. Yet these services have been vastly undervalued and under-resourced. Studies estimate a US$900 billion gap in annual funding needed for conservation critical to maintaining biodiversity and climate outcomes. The field of conservation finance aims to address this massive financing gap as well as the multitude of ways global markets and policies shortchange nature. Conservation finance umbrellas a variety of concepts, including (but not limited to) payments for ecosystem services, nature-based solutions, and environmental markets. In this course, we will focus on key concepts, tools, and challenges in this space. The course will be multidisciplinary, much like the field itself, which reaches across the intersections of ecology, economics, policy, finance, and human rights. 

This is a 1-credit equivalent academic course (16 contact hrs + additional work) where you learn at your own pace over 3 months.

About Our Research Lab 

The Ortiz Lab was established in 2020 and conducts research in urban wildlife and conservation education. Our wildlife research primarily utilizes non-invasive techniques to study our wild neighbors’ behavior, population, and habitat use in urban spaces through observational methods like surveys and camera trapping and computer software like GIS. It is important to us for our community members to gain an appreciation and awareness of wildlife and conduct work on research experiences in the classroom, K-12 teacher training, summer camp presentations and more. Each semester we aim to hold one outreach event in our community. Previous events include the Family Bird Festival and P-22 Day. Currently, we have 2 Master’s students, 8 active undergraduate researchers, and many committed volunteers to help achieve our research goals.

More information about our lab including our ongoing projects and our team can be found at www.janelortiz.com or ortizlab_cpp on Instagram. 

Desired Qualifications 

By the start date, candidates must hold a Bachelor’s degree in Biology or related major. Prior experience with GIS and drones is preferred but not required. The candidate must be an effective leader and able to work well with others as this is a large project that will require the assistance of undergraduate researchers, communication with community members, and detailed scheduling. The ability to conduct field work in urban spaces, standing and sitting for extended periods of time, and looking upwards for a period of time will be required. Excellent communication with advisor, committee, research team, and community partners, time-management skills, a strong work ethic, and attention to detail are also essential. The candidate must also have a valid driver’s license or be able to obtain a valid driver’s license immediately upon starting in order to drive to field sites. Use of a reliable vehicle is required for field work. The candidate must also have a drone license or be able to obtain one soon after starting the position. 

Compensation 

Teaching assistantship (for at least 2 years), part-time hourly ($20/hr in 1st year), plus other supplements such as a grading position or graduate assistantship which are selective and based upon availability. Work study may also be applied depending on your financial aid package and availability. Grants and fellowship opportunities do come up and will be pursued to help supplement financial support. 

Deadline 

Review of applications will begin immediately and will continue until the position is filled. All inquiries can be sent to Dr. Janel Ortiz (jortiz@cpp.edu).

Description
COURSE DESCRIPTION - Research and management questions often focus on obtaining robust estimates of abundance, density, population growth, state transition, and/or vital rates to obtain insights into population status and drivers of change. Among the most popular and diverse approaches to estimating such parameters includes a suite of sampling and analytical methods known as capture-mark-recapture (mark-recap or several similar terms). This class will focus on providing a solid foundation for using these techniques for a broad range of objectives. We emphasize asking good questions, identifying appropriate sampling methods rooted in animal behavior and ecology, and choosing the right analytical techniques in both MARK and RMark. We will show how simulations can be used to improve study design and discuss their limitations. For many of the exercises in this course, we will focus on analyzing data from large-scale grizzly bear projects co-led by Dr. Stetz. Focusing on this case study will help practitioners see more clearly how the elements of a study (background, objectives, field methods, analyses, and modeling assumptions) interact, and how this leads to better study design and execution.

Description
COURSE DESCRIPTION - Distance sampling is a frequently used method for estimating species abundance using point counts and line transects while accounting for imperfect detection. This method is based on the simple premise that animals on or near the sampling point/line transect are more likely to be detected than animals further away. This method can be implemented on unmarked animals during a single site visit, which can be appealing compared to other approaches that require marked animals or multiple site visits (i.e., temporal replicates). Users can, however, incorporate marked animals and/or collect data with temporal replication to address questions about availability, seasonal change, and annual trends. Distance sampling can be implemented on the ground (e.g., foot, vehicle), by air (e.g., airplane, helicopter), and by water (e.g., ship, raft), and therefore useful in terrestrial, aquatic, and marine ecosystems. This course will provide a foundation in distance sampling with numerous examples of their use. Students will gain practical experience in distance sampling, including study design, data collection, data management, and analytical techniques. Analyses will be conducted in R using the unmarked package. Students will be able to implement these models, interpret their output, and summarize the results.

COURSE DESCRIPTION - BAYESIAN CAUSAL NETWORKS FOR COMPLEX MULTIVARIATE SYSTEMS

This course is designed to provide the fundamental understanding and developing Bayesian Causal Network (BCN) models for integrative analyses. A BCN refers to a probabilistic graphical model, specifically a Bayesian network (also called Bayesian Belief Network), designed to represent causal relationships between multiple variables in complex systems. BCN modeling is advantageous when dealing with many interconnected variables (multivariate) where direct cause-and-effect relationships might not be readily apparent; it allows for the analysis of how changes in one variable can influence others within the system, taking into account uncertainties and dependencies between variables. The initial model can be useful to determine leverage points for interventions. Due to the stability of most complex systems, the model can also predict possible outcomes based on changes to the variables or their intensity when testing interventions. 

This course will walk you through the development of multiple stages of BCN modeling, including a decision net (which optimizes decisions) and an influence net. Additionally, simple BCN will be created in the third module and added to in the final module, resulting in a more complex aggregate model. This process will enable you to predict, monitor, and update your model indefinitely. You will become proficient in using the software Netica, and the modeling process used in Netica is applicable to most Bayesian network software currently available.

This is a 1-credit equivalent academic course (16 contact hrs + additional work) where you learn at your own pace over 3 months.

COURSE DESCRIPTION - This course provides you with the ability to analyze a wide variety of ecological data in R, including counts, proportions, and continuous measurements, such as length and weight. Much of the course is concerned with fitting generalized linear models (GLMs), as these are a basic requirement for modern quantitative ecology and wildlife management. We cover Poisson and binomial models in detail, and extensions of these when the data are overdispersed and/or zero-inflated. We also cover the use of generalized additive models (GAMs) to fit flexible, non-linear curves to model the relationship between a response variable and a numerical predictor, such as distance or depth. We discuss model-checking and residual diagnostics, to see how well our model fits the data, and model comparison using AIC in order to see which terms should be included. Repeated measurements data, in which the response variable is measured at several points in time, are also considered in detail. We explain the distinction between fixed and random effects and show how to fit models that involve random effects.

Description
COURSE DESCRIPTION - Our planet, including our atmosphere, forests, water, and other living entities, are fundamental to human survival. Yet these services have been vastly undervalued and under-resourced. Studies estimate a US$900 billion gap in annual funding needed for conservation critical to maintaining biodiversity and climate outcomes. The field of conservation finance aims to address this massive financing gap as well as the multitude of ways global markets and policies shortchange nature. Conservation finance umbrellas a variety of concepts, including (but not limited to) payments for ecosystem services, nature-based solutions, and environmental markets. In this course, we will focus on key concepts, tools, and challenges in this space. The course will be multidisciplinary, much like the field itself, which reaches across the intersections of ecology, economics, policy, finance, and human rights.

KEY QUESTIONS
What is conservation finance and what is its role in biodiversity, water, and climate?
What are the range of existing finance strategies and tools?
What bottlenecks hold back conservation finance?
What are examples of conservation finance in the field?
How does policy drive or shape or omit conservation finance?
What are the different roles of public and private financing?

Description
*Applications will be reviewed on a rolling-basis.

USDA Forest Service Office/Lab and Location: A fellowship opportunity is available with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service (FS) within the Pacific Southwest Research Station (PSWRS). This opportunity is remote.

At the heart of the USDA Forest Service's mission is their purpose. Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency’s mission and motivates their work across the agency. It’s been there from the agency’s very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the USDA Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.

Research Project: This research fellowship will use long-term (2002-2019) experimental data from the Goosenest Adaptive Management Area, a study of fuels reduction and forest restoration alternatives for managing east-side ponderosa pine/mixed-conifer forests. The treatments included group selection management to promote structural complexity, making them a useful test of different modeling approaches in the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS). Currently FVS users, which largely consist of federal land managers, have a few different way of modeling complex restoration treatments in the software. However there is not much guidance on which is most accurate, or how examples of calibrating the model to improve its performance This project will A) help calibrate the FVS growth and mortality models and b) advance the modeling of complex treatments to save agencies time and money.

The research fellow's main focus will be performing the FVS runs to compare observed vs. predicted values the 20 year span of the experiment. The fellow would contribute to completing a manuscript in preparation, have a chance to interact with regional land managers to share results, and pursue original research with this dataset. Possible independent research projects include quantifying the biomass benefits of proactive forest management, and quantifying how treatments improved outcomes after the 2021 Antelope Fire which burned over this study. Data are already proofed and formatted with a draft FVS workflow, preparing the fellow for success.

The fellowship would run from June-September 2025. Fellows are not U.S. government employees but instead paid interns through the Oak Ridge of Science and Engineering hosted by the USDA-FS. Due to the short tenure of the fellowship, remote participation is accepted but depending on location the selected candidate may opt for office space in Placerville, Vallejo, Redding, Riverside, or Arcata, California.

Learning Objectives: 

Improve knowledge of issues and science surrounding forest restoration and hazardous fuels reduction
Advance skills for modeling silvicultural treatments in industry-standard software
Learn how to communicate the benefits of active forest management in terms of ecosystem services
Gain advanced data analysis skills in linear modeling and visualization
Experience collaborating as a key member of a research project team
Learn about science leadership by pursuing original research
Mentor: The mentor for this opportunity is Christopher Looney (christopher.looney@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor.

Anticipated Appointment Start Date: June 1, 2025.  Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.

Appointment Length: The appointment will initially be for four months but may be extended upon recommendation of USDA Forest Service and is contingent on the availability of funds.

Level of Participation: The appointment is full time.

Participant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend is $5,678 monthly. Fellows receive an additional $680 monthly stipend for health, vision, and dental insurance. The fellow would also have a $500 budget for travel or local conference attendance, such as the California Society of American Forester's Summer Meeting. 

Citizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents (LPR) only.

ORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and USDA Forest Service. Participants do not become employees of USDA, USDA Forest Service, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits. Proof of health insurance is required for participation in this program. Health insurance can be obtained through ORISE.

Questions: Please visit our Program Website. After reading, if you have additional questions about the application process please email ORISE.USFS.PSWRS@orau.org and include the reference code for this opportunity.

ROLE OVERVIEW:
 Are you ready to leverage your expertise and take on a leadership role in the field of environmental consulting? At SummitWest, the Senior Wildlife Biologist at SummitWest is a subject matter expert who will leverage their extensive experience in wildlife, botanical,  or wetland field surveys to support natural resource projects throughout California and occasionally in Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, and beyond.

The Senior Wildlife Biologist will lead field surveys, mentor junior staff, guide project planning, and assist with report preparation, permitting, and client coordination. This position requires exceptional organizational skills, flexibility, and a collaborative spirit to manage projects in a variety of terrains and weather conditions. 

If you’re motivated by dynamic challenges, enjoy mentoring the next generation of professionals, and excel at driving compliance success in the field, this is the opportunity for you.

ROLE DESCRIPTION & DUTIES:
The Senior Wildlife Biologist will conduct diverse natural resource tasks under the guidance of Project Managers, Environmental Coordinators, and Environmental Schedulers. Duties include but are not limited to:

Once a framework is established with pronghorn, responsibilities will shift to similar work on mule deer, desert bighorn, elk, and aoudad. These projects are based on large, long-term GPS data sets and satellite imagery products. A background in animal movement ecology with strong statistical analysis and R programming skills are preferred, but we are committed to helping the right candidate grow in these areas. The successful applicant will work alongside faculty to explore how these species respond to changing habitat conditions, each other, restoration efforts, and management practices in the Chihuahuan Desert. The candidate will collaborate closely with BRI partners (e.g., private landowners, NGOs, universities, etc.) to support sustainable big game management practices within the Chihuahuan Desert ecosystem.

Key Responsibilities:
• Integrate within a multidisciplinary team, collaborating with experts in various fields to advance BRl’s mission.
• Supervise field activities and graduate students associated with 5+ big game field projects.
• Help direct an established research program focused on how wildlife responds to large scale management efforts, with a particular emphasis on the Chihuahuan Desert ecosystem.
• Mentor undergraduate and graduate students, guiding their research projects and academic development.
• Secure external funding through grant writing to support research initiatives.
• Publish research findings in high-impact scientific journals, contributing significantly to community and restoration ecology.

Description
Are you a student or recent graduate with exceptional GIS or QGIS skills? Do you want to use your expertise to contribute to wildlife conservation while working in a breathtaking natural environment? The Bushveld Biodiversity Research Centre (BBRC) is offering an exciting 3-month internship where you can make a meaningful impact while refining your technical and research skills.  

About Us:  
The BBRC is located on a 27,000-hectare wildlife reserve—boasting 17 antelope species and two of the Big Five—dedicated to biodiversity research and preservation. Our work spans diverse projects, including giraffe population monitoring, bird habitat research, vegetation studies, and documenting wildflowers, butterflies, and other insects. We’re now seeking someone to enhance our mapping efforts and support our research with GIS technology.  

The Role: 
As a GIS intern, you’ll play a vital role in creating and refining detailed reserve maps, as well as updating project-specific maps and layers. This is a unique opportunity to merge technical expertise with conservation efforts. 

Your role will include:  
- Map Creation & Updates: Use GIS or QGIS to bring more detail to our reserve maps and create layered maps for individual research projects.  
- Data Integration: Collaborate with researchers to integrate project-specific data into the GIS framework, such as tracking wildlife movements or habitat preferences.  
- Project Support: Join ongoing mini-projects, applying your GIS expertise to enhance research on biodiversity, vegetation zones, or species distribution.  
- Knowledge Sharing: Provide input on how GIS tools can improve the efficiency and impact of our conservation efforts.  

What Makes This Internship Special: 
In addition to using and improving your GIS skills, you’ll have the chance to:  
- Work in an environment surrounded by untouched natural beauty and incredible wildlife.  
- Join fieldwork alongside researchers, integrating GIS tools into practical conservation projects.  
- Contribute directly to meaningful biodiversity research in a largely understudied region.  

What We’re Looking For: 
- A student or recent graduate skilled in GIS or QGIS.  
- A passion for conservation and an interest in applying GIS to support wildlife research.  
- Experience in creating detailed maps and managing spatial data.  
- A proactive approach to work, with strong problem-solving skills.  

Please note that a monthly conservation fee is required, which covers the following:
Conservation Fees: As you’ll be staying on a wildlife reserve, a portion of your fee will go towards supporting the protection and care of the land and the species that inhabit it.

   Comfortable accommodation will be provided during your stay.

Transportation: Pick-up from and drop-off at the Polokwane airport, weekly or bi-weekly town trips for students to restock supplies, and daily drives around the reserve.

This fee ensures that your experience contributes to both your well-being and the vital work of preserving the reserve.

Duration of Stay: 
Flexible | We recommend a commitment of 2 to 4 months to fully immerse yourself in the experience. 

Application Details:  
Submit your resume and a brief cover letter to research@bushveldbiodiversity.org

If you are interested in this internship but unavailable on the specified dates, please still reach out to us and submit your CV and cover letter. We can discuss alternative dates and check our project schedule for availability. 

We eagerly look forward to welcoming passionate individuals to our team!

Description
Job Description:
 The Washington Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) and Washington State University (WSU) are hiring 1–2 field technician positions to assist a graduate student in studying snowshoe hare ecology in the Loomis State Forest, located in the eastern Cascades foothills of north-central Washington. The project focuses on how spatial behavior and population demography are influenced by pre-commercial thinning treatments. Pay is $20.45/hour, 40 hours per week. Successful applicants will start on 1 Aug 2025 (at the earliest) and work through 31 Oct 2025.  

The technicians will work both independently and as crew members with other WDNR and WSU personnel and will collect data in the field involving a combination of live trapping, hare handling/processing, VHF radio telemetry, and investigating hare mortalities. In addition, there will be many opportunities to assist with camera trap deployment, vegetation sampling, and fecal pellet counts. Competitive applicants will be comfortable navigating and hauling bulky live traps through dense regenerating forests and recently thinned stands covered in slash on uneven terrain. 

The project field sites are located in a cold-temperate montane forest environment where the weather is unpredictable both daily and seasonally. Terrain is often rugged, and sites are located away from electricity, running water, and cell service. Thus, we expect that competitive applicants will have substantial field experience in all types of environments and weather conditions. 

Technicians must be able to maintain a positive outlook during difficult field conditions and work effectively with a cohesive team, including a PhD student and other seasonal technicians. Shared housing is provided by WSU at an apartment in nearby Tonasket, WA (~20-minute drive from the state forest) but camping in the state forest for short periods is possible.

Description
The Wyoming Migration Initiative is seeking a field technician to lead Fall Fawn Recruitment Surveys and join Autumn captures (i.e., animal handling, sample collection) during Autumn 2025 on a large study of migratory mule deer wintering in Wyoming’s Red Desert.

Job Duties: Specific tasks include: (1) navigating remote 4x4 roads – but mostly using good judgement, (2) triangulating collared animals with ground telemetry, (3a) recording group composition and (3b) the number of fawns of collared adult females, and (4) performing cause-specific mortality investigations and post-mortem collections. Other tasks include: (1) nightly data entry, (2) vehicle problems reporting, (3) maintaining clean living and working environment, (4) maintaining professional relationships with state and federal collaborators, and (5) a nightly check-in with project lead (Luke Wilde, PhD student). Additionally, the technician will assist in mule deer captures (note: no past capture experience required), collar/capture kit preparation, and sample breakdown. 

Qualifications: Successful applicants should have experience with at least some of the following: (1) ground telemetry, (2) operating ½-ton trucks in rugged conditions and/or off-road, (3) basic vehicle maintenance (i.e., change tire, fitting chains), and (4) backcountry navigation with gps/smartphone app. Applicants with an ability to identify deer age- and sex-classes or those with hunting experience are encouraged to apply.

Salary and Details: $13-17/hr (DOE) for 40 hr/wk, no overtime pay. Technicians will have ample opportunities to network with researchers and wildlife managers from around Wyoming during and after the position’s term. Housing and field vehicles will be provided for the duration of the work at no cost. 

How to apply: Please send an email with the subject “Red Desert FFR 2025” containing: (1) a single page cover letter describing your experiences and interest in the position, (2) a professional CV and (3) two references with contact information to lwilde2@uwyo.edu

(see these resources for your CV: https://www.esa.org/programs/student-programs/resume-resources/).

Study Description: The Sublette mule deer herd contains the longest terrestrial migration in the lower-48. While some deer migrate the astounding 150 miles (long-distance) to have their fawns in the montane forests, others in the herd migrate <70 miles (medium-distance), <30 miles (short-distance), or not at all (year-round residents). Since 2014, we have been studying the migrations of this population to understand the processes that sustain mule deer herds in the long-term and inform management of landscapes to promote seasonal migrations. The Red Desert is one of the most intact, non-wilderness areas in the US and is world-known for its alien landscapes, unique geology, and desert flora/fauna.

Description
We seek a postdoctoral research associate with a strong background in quantitative modeling to aid in developing a decision support tool to project effects of increased fish passage on productivity of fish species in streams in the Great Lakes region. Terminal barrier removal in the Great Lakes region requires considering tradeoffs for native fish passage, needs for increased sea lamprey control, and passage of other potentially undesirable species (e.g., Pacific salmonids). Therefore, decision makers need a modeling framework to enable them to understand potential changes in fish production as novel habitats are opened through barrier removal or remediation. The hired associate will work closely with a technical working group comprised of a mixture of highly-engaged federal, state, and university biologists to identify case study streams in collaboration with local rightsholders, NGOs, and stakeholders, update an existing individual-based model to expand its utility from one stream to many and incorporate the effects of ecosystem change into fish production projections, and help devise a framework for development of a basin-wide decision support tool to predict fish production under different levels of fish passage. Additional responsibilities include presenting research to partners, technical committees, and at scientific conferences, as well as preparing manuscripts and reports. The hired associate will be part of the Georgia Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit, located at the University of Georgia, in Athens, GA; working from a remote location may be possible. Other related duties may also be assigned as needs arise (e.g., required training, contribution to general operation of the research unit). Further, lab members are expected to help maintain a supportive collegiate environment. Candidate would ideally start in Summer 2025.

Qualified candidates will have a PhD in fisheries science, wildlife science, or related discipline with a strong quantitative background and record of research productivity in quantitative methods. Experience in individual-based modeling, fish production modeling, and structured decision making is desirable, as well as experience or desire to work with stakeholders, rightsholders, and agency personnel.

All applicants must apply through www.ugajobsearch.com. Search for posting #G/R29564P. Please include your CV, letter of interest, transcripts (unofficial), and contact information for three references. Questions about this position can be directed to Dr. Kelly Robinson (kfrobinson@uga.edu). Applications will be accepted until the position is filled, but review will begin on June 1.

Description
Description: Dr. Stuart Ludsin (https://u.osu.edu/ludsinlab/) is seeking a post-doctoral scientist to help on a long-term project designed to advance the use of ecosystem-based approaches to fisheries management in the North American Great Lakes Basin. The post-doc would be expected to conduct literature reviews, organize workshops, and implement surveys of database managers/developers, fishery managers, and academic and agency researchers, to help identify a data-sharing architecture (“database ecosystem”) suitable for use in the Great Lakes Basin. A potential need to conduct structured or semi-structured interviews also exists. Ideally, this database ecosystem would allow end-users  (e.g., academic and agency researchers, fishery managers) to simultaneously query independent Great Lakes databases and download their needed data through a user-friendly online interface.

In addition to writing and submitting manuscripts for publication to peer-reviewed journals, the post-doc would be expected to present findings at management and scientific meetings, as well as help generate annual progress reports to the Great Lakes Fishery Commission, which is this project’s sponsor. The opportunity to contribute to ongoing fisheries-focused research in the Great Lakes basin, including refining and using an independent Great Lakes Recruitment and Ecosystem (GLaRE) database, would also exist, if of interest.

Funding exists for two years, with an ideal start time being summer 2025.

Qualifications: Required qualifications include: (1) a PhD in social science, data science, computer science, information systems, environmental science, ecology, or related field; (2) demonstrated ability to conduct independent research, as evidenced by peer-reviewed publications; and (3) strong written and oral communication skills, including the ability and desire to interact with Great Lakes stakeholders and database managers/developers from diverse international organizations. While knowledge of database development and associated programming could prove beneficial, it is not required.

Salary: $61,008 - $63,000 annually, depending on experience, plus a comprehensive benefits package.

Location: Successful candidates would join a dynamic, interactive group of faculty, post-docs, and students at the Aquatic Ecology Laboratory (AEL; http://ael.osu.edu/) in the Department of Evolution, Ecology, and Organismal Biology (http://eeob.osu.edu/) on The Ohio State University’s main (Columbus) campus. Computing support and office space would be available in the AEL. Working remotely is NOT possible.

How to apply: Submit to apps.ael@gmail.comin a single .pdf file: 1) a cover letter highlighting your research background and interests; 2) a full CV; and 3) names and contact information of three references. Please include “Database Postdoc” and your last name in the subject line.

Application review will begin May 19th and continue until a suitable candidate is found. Questions about the position can be addressed to Stuart Ludsin (ludsin.1@osu.edu).

 The Ohio State University is an equal opportunity employer, including veterans and disability.

Description
The Palmquist Lab at Marshall University is recruiting for a funded MS position at Marshall University in climate change and fire effects on coastal vegetation. Our research focuses on quantifying vegetation dynamics over space and time and identifying how the relative importance of ecological processes structuring plant communities changes with spatial and temporal scale. In addition, a key goal of our research is to understand how pattern and process in plant communities will be altered in the face of global environmental change. An important motivation for our work is to address ecological questions at large spatial scales to inform landscape conservation. We collect field data, use existing large observational data sets, and implement simulation modeling to address these goals in temperate shrublands, wetlands, woodlands, and forests. Additional information about the lab can be found at http://www.kylepalmquist.org/.
 RESEARCH FOCUS: The successful candidate will explore the interacting effects of sea-level rise and increased storm surge on coastal vegetation and the effects of prescribed fire on pine-dominated vegetation on Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island (MCRDPI), a sea-island in South Carolina. Coastal vegetation provides important ecosystem services, including storm protection, erosion control, and habitat for wildlife. These complex, highly zoned plant communities are structured by multiple environmental factors including salinity, elevation, soil texture, soil moisture, exposure, and light availability. Sea-level rise and intensification of the hydrologic cycle (i.e. more frequent and intense storms) is expected to affect the distribution and composition of coastal vegetation in the future, with important implications. Prescribed fire has been implemented in pine woodlands and forests on the island to enhance their resilience to climate change and to restore their structure from closed forests to open woodlands. The effects of prescribed fire have yet to be assessed. The project will integrate remote sensing, plant community sampling, and modeling to quantify how sea-level rise and associated factors have impacted coastal vegetation up to present and how climate change may influence vegetation in the future. An additional goal is to assess how prescribed fire is influencing pine-dominated vegetation on the island by installing and re-sampling permanent vegetation plots.   
 PREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS: A background, including relevant course work, in botany or plant ecology, and GIS or remote sensing, strong communication skills, and strong quantitative skills. Experience in remote sensing and GIS and knowledge of the southeastern US flora is highly desirable.
 EXPECTATIONS: The successful candidate will be expected to conduct high-quality research, serve as a teaching assistant within the Department of Biological Sciences, present their research to the scientific community at regional and national meetings, and publish in peer-reviewed scientific journals.
 TIMELINE: The position is available starting January 2026 and possibly before.
 FUNDING: Funding will consist of a combination of research and teaching assistantships for two years. A 12-month competitive stipend ($20,000), and full tuition waiver will be provided. The student is responsible for covering University fees.
 HOW TO APPLY: Interested students should apply by submitting the following to Dr. Kyle Palmquist (palmquist@marshall.edu): 1) short statement of research interests and career goals (no longer than 1 page), 2) CV, 3) unofficial transcripts, and 4) contact information for three professional references. Please include: “MS position – coastal vegetation” and your name in the email subject.
 Review of applications will begin immediately and continue until a candidate is selected. I will contact you to discuss your research interests and goals for graduate school if I determine you would be a good fit for the lab. If selected, a full application must be submitted to the Department of Biological Sciences at Marshall University, Huntington, WV. Faculty in the Department of Biological Sciences have expertise in a variety of biological fields, including but not limited to ecology, evolution, herpetology, and physiology.

Additional information about the lab can be found at http://www.kylepalmquist.org/. 
 RESEARCH FOCUS: The successful candidate will broadly explore the interacting effects of climate change, wildfire, and livestock grazing intensity on big sagebrush plant communities throughout their spatial extent in the western US. These water-limited ecosystems are undergoing rapid environmental change due to multiple stressors (climate change, increases in wildfire activity, species invasions) and represent some of the most threatened systems in North America. This project is supported by a five-year NSF grant and will leverage an individual-based plant simulation model to quantify the impacts of multiple global change drivers on big sagebrush plant communities under future conditions. Potential focal projects the MS student would lead include: the role of competition in altering plant functional type responses to global change drivers and the implications for shrub-grass coexistence or leveraging livestock grazing as a tool to prevent the spread of invasive species and decrease wildfire risk under a future climate. This project will provide collaborative opportunities with ecologists at Yale University, and with scientists and managers from multiple federal agencies (BLM, USGS, USFWS, USFS, USDA ARS). 
 REQUIRED QUALIFICATIONS: A background and relevant course work in ecology and statistics, knowledge and experience in sagebrush ecosystems of the western U.S., strong communication skills, and strong quantitative skills. Experience in ecological modeling and computer programming is highly desirable. An interest in learning modeling is required.
 EXPECTATIONS: The successful candidate will be expected to conduct high-quality research, serve as a teaching assistant within the Department of Biological Sciences for one year, present their research to the scientific community at regional and national meetings, and publish in peer-reviewed scientific journals.
 TIMELINE: The position is available starting August 2025 or January 2026.

Description
AUBURN UNIVERSITY
School of Fisheries, Aquaculture, and Aquatic Sciences
Postdoctoral Researcher - Ecology of Harmful Algal Blooms
 The School of Fisheries, Aquaculture, and Aquatic Sciences at Auburn University is seeking candidates for a Postdoctoral Researcher to work both independently and collaboratively with members of our research team to develop research projects that further our understanding of the ecology of freshwater harmful algal blooms. The incumbent will join an active lab (https://wilsonlab.com/) whose recent research activities integrate large-scale, whole pond and mesocosm experiments, lake surveys, remote sensing, statistical modelling, and meta-analysis to understand the importance of abiotic and biotic factors that affect the promotion or control of algal blooms in aquaculture ponds and drinking water and recreational reservoirs. The incumbent will have ample opportunities to participate in existing USDAS supported lab projects, develop new research directions, and support the writing of research proposals and manuscripts. This is a benefit eligible, non-tenure track position. The appointment is for an initial period of one year with a possibility of continuance up to a maximum of four years depending on performance and funding availability.  In addition to professional development opportunities available in our lab, Auburn University offers many resources for our postdoc community - http://graduate.auburn.edu/postdoc/
 I am motivated to maintain a productive, diverse, and inclusive lab and encourage individuals from under-represented groups to consider joining us.  Moreover, lab members are strongly encouraged to develop outreach activities to broaden the impact of their research.
 Available infrastructure: Our lab is fully equipped for field and lab-based research. The incumbent will have access to trucks, boats, sampling gear, microscopes, and analytical chemistry and molecular tools. In addition, the School of Fisheries manages a spectacular field station with more than 300 ponds that vary in size, shape, depth, and productivity that the incumbent will be encouraged to use as part of their research efforts.  We also collaborate with diverse stakeholders throughout the US, such as aquaculture farmers, water utilities, non-profits, natural resource managers, and academics, that could be leveraged as part of this position. 
 Qualifications: The minimum qualification is an earned Ph.D. in Biology, Aquaculture, Microbiology, Ecology, Limnology, Analytical Chemistry, Molecular Ecology, or closely related field at the time employment begins. The Postdoctoral Researcher is expected to conduct research related to the ecology of harmful algal blooms. Selected candidates must have knowledge/experience with harmful algal blooms, experience with analyzing experimental and monitoring data sets, and significant experience with manuscript preparation and publication. Although we welcome all candidates with prior experience related to harmful algal blooms, research areas that we are particular interested in growing in the lab include biogeochemistry, ecotoxicology, and molecular approaches to study interactions between cyanobacteria and associated organisms. Given that we serve diverse stakeholders, strong communication skills are also required. The individual selected for the position must be able to meet eligibility requirements for work in the United States by the start date and continue working legally for the proposed term of employment. 
 How to apply: Applicants must complete an on-line application process at the following link: https://www.auemployment.com/postings/45964 and attach the following: 1) cover letter stating research interests and career goals, 2) current curriculum vita, and 3) copies of all academic transcripts. When prompted, please provide names, phone numbers, and email addresses of three professional references. Only complete application materials will be considered. Active review of applications will continue until the position is filled. Salary (~$55,000/yr) will be commensurate with education and experience.

Description
The Palmquist Lab at Marshall University is recruiting for an NSF funded postdoctoral research associate focused on evaluating the impacts of multiple global change drivers on dryland plant communities. Our research focuses on quantifying vegetation dynamics over space and time and identifying how the relative importance of ecological processes structuring plant communities changes with spatial and temporal scale. In addition, a key goal of our research is to understand how pattern and process in plant communities will be altered in the face of global environmental change. An important motivation for our work is to address ecological questions at large spatial scales to inform landscape conservation. We collect field data, use existing large observational data sets, and implement simulation modeling to address these goals in temperate shrublands, wetlands, woodlands, and forests. Additional information about the lab can be found at http://www.kylepalmquist.org/. 
 RESEARCH FOCUS: The successful candidate will broadly explore the interacting effects of climate change, wildfire, and livestock grazing intensity on big sagebrush plant communities throughout their spatial extent in the western US via ecological modeling. These water-limited ecosystems are undergoing rapid environmental change due to multiple stressors (climate change, increases in wildfire activity, species invasions) and represent some of the most threatened systems in North America. This project is supported by a five-year NSF CAREER grant and will leverage an individual-based plant simulation model (STEPWAT2) to quantify the impacts of multiple global change drivers on big sagebrush plant communities under future conditions. Potential focal projects include but are not limited to: investigating the role of competition in altering plant functional type responses to global change drivers and the implications for shrub-grass coexistence, identifying the likelihood of ecosystem state transitions under a future climate, and investigating how livestock grazing can be used as a tool to maintain native plant cover and prevent invasion by non-native species. This project will provide collaborative and networking opportunities with ecologists at Yale University, and with scientists and managers from multiple federal agencies (BLM, USGS, USFWS, USFS, USDA ARS). 
 REQUIRED QUALIFICATIONS: 
·      A PhD in ecology or a related field with relevant course work in ecology and statistics and a demonstrated publication record in these fields
·      Knowledge of and/or experience working in sagebrush ecosystems of the western U.S.
·      Strong quantitative skills and experience in ecological modeling and computer programming in R and Unix environments
·      Excellent organizational skills, attention to detail, and ability to work both independently and collaboratively in a team environment
·      Strong written and verbal communication skills
 EXPECTATIONS: The successful candidate will be expected to conduct high-quality research, present their research to the scientific community at regional and national meetings, publish in peer-reviewed scientific journals, and mentor undergraduate and graduate students in collaborative settings. The candidate will have the opportunity to gain additional teaching experience in the Department of Biological Sciences, at a minimum by presenting their research via guest lectures within Palmquist’s existing ecology classes (Principles of Ecology, Plant Ecology). The candidate will also be expected to participate in educational and outreach activities with Marshall University undergraduates and the Northern Arapaho tribes in Wyoming.
 TIMELINE: The position is available starting March 2026 and must be filled no later than June 2026.
 FUNDING: Funding is available for two years and five months at $55,000 per year. Full benefits (health insurance and retirement) will be provided. Funding beyond one year will be contingent on satisfactory job performance.
 LOCATION: The position will be based at Marshall University in Huntington, WV. For the right candidate, remote work may be considered.
 Marshall University is located in Huntington, an affordable college town located on the Ohio River in the beautiful state of West Virginia. The town is small enough to get around on foot and bike, but large enough to support a variety of restaurants and other cultural activities. Huntington and the surrounding area offer ample recreational opportunities (hiking, skiing, rafting), along with proximity to larger cities, including Louisville, KY, Cincinnati, OH, and Columbus, OH. In the Palmquist Lab, we highly value and encourage work-life balance. Faculty in the Department of Biological Sciences have expertise in a variety of biological fields, including but not limited to ecology, evolution, herpetology, and physiology. More information about the Department and its programs can be found here: https://www.marshall.edu/biology/.
 HOW TO APPLY: Interested individuals should apply by submitting the following to Dr. Kyle Palmquist (palmquist@marshall.edu). Please include: “Postdoc position - dryland plant communities” and your name in the email subject.
 1) cover letter describing research interests and career goals (no longer than 2 pages)

Description
 Would you like to live in the middle of the Amazon rainforest as part of a fantastic multicultural team while helping to preserve wild macaws? Add to that learning a new set of skills and gaining great field experience at one of the longest-running parrot projects in the Americas? If this sounds good to you, come and join our team of dedicated volunteers!

For over two decades, we’ve been working in the lowlands of southeastern Peru, led by Drs. Brightsmith and Vigo-Trauco from Texas A&M’s Schubot Center for Avian Health. Our research focuses on the breeding ecology of wild parrots and macaws in Tambopata, a region critical to conservation since 1999.

Volunteers are the backbone of our work, contributing thousands of hours to understanding these incredible birds. Whether you’re passionate about wildlife, have a background in biology, or are just eager to gain field experience, we welcome you to be part of this rewarding journey.

With various programs designed for all experience levels—from birdwatching enthusiasts to graduate-level professionals—there’s an opportunity for everyone who’s responsible, enthusiastic, and ready for an adventure in conservation. Are you ready for a hands-on conservation experience in one of the most biodiverse places on Earth? Come join us in making a real difference!

We have different volunteer assistantships programs that require different levels of experience from amateur enthusiasts and birdwatchers to graduate-level professionals. Volunteer activities vary according to the position.

LONG TERM VOLUNTEER ASSISTANT

 Join our team and be trained to identify all local parrots by sight and sound. You’ll conduct parrot censuses in the forest and at clay licks, locate foraging parrots, and enter collected data into our system. During the macaw breeding season, you’ll learn to climb trees using rope systems and observe macaw behavior around nests. Additional duties include campsite setup and cooking. 

SHORT VOLUNTEER ASSISTANT

In this role, you will receive quick training to assist our field team in monitoring macaw nests from the ground, supporting the team that works with ropes. You will also be trained to monitor macaw behavior around nests and help with clay lick observations. Due to the shorter stay, involvement in activities like parrot censuses and tree climbing will be limited. Other responsibilities include campsite setup and cooking.

SPONSORED LONG TERM VOLUNTEER POSITION

Be part of the “Harrison's Bird Foods Internship in the Rainforest Program”! You will receive comprehensive training similar to our long-term volunteers, including parrot identification, conducting censuses, monitoring foraging behaviors, tracking tree species macaws use, and entering data. In addition to tree climbing and nest observation, you’ll also assist with macaw chick health checks, including taking biometric measurements. You’ll play a key role in our nest monitoring expeditions throughout the Tambopata River basin. As with all positions, activities include campsite setup and cooking.

COST
Essentially, volunteering is free. We take care of research permit costs, cover the costs of all staff, work to maintain training material, and also deal with all correspondence and various aspects of project management. However, our budget does not extend to being able to pay for all aspects of volunteer participation. As such you only need to cover food, accommodation, and other services provided by the field station. The costs are very reasonable. The daily fee is according to the position and experience:

• Long-term assistant: 30 USD/day 

• Short-term assistant: 45 USD/day 

• SPONSORED Long-term assistant: NO COST (Thanks to the generous sponsorship from Harrison's Bird Foods) 


*A one-time processing fee of $30 will be added for all volunteers.
This rate covers food (3 meals per day) and accommodations (bedding is provided). All volunteers will be charged an airport transfer to be picked up ($20) or dropped off ($10) at the airport plus an extra cost to be transported to the port in private transportation ($45). Once a volunteer was accepted, they will be sent an invoice by email from Texas A&M University. Upon receipt, the volunteer needs to pay 20% of the total cost of their stay. This non-refundable payment is required to hold the reservation for the assistant. The remaining 80% of the payment should be made at least two weeks before the assistant arrives at the release site. Arrangements can be made if assistants wish to pay in cash in the country. However, prior permission from the coordinator is needed. Changes to the daily fee may apply according to availability and season

(Forthcoming) Postdoctoral Researcher and/or Field Technician position(s) in wildlife ecology at Brown University, Providence RI


Topic areas:  wildlife ecology, biogeography, conservation science, environmental science, habitat suitability modeling/geospatial analysis, field studies, muskrat ecology

Description:  The Institute at Brown for Environment and Society (IBES) at Brown University will be seeking a Postdoctoral Researcher and/or Field Technician with experience in wildlife ecology, remote sensing/geospatial analysis, field data collection, habitat suitability modeling, or related field for a NASA-funded field and geospatial study of declining muskrat populations in the Northeastern U.S.A.  The study will begin September 2025, run for at least three years, and is a collaboration of Brown University, the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (RIDEM), and the USDA National Genomics Center for Wildlife and Fish Conservation. 


Background: There is a growing realization that muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus) are experiencing precipitous, widespread population decline across North America.  This unexplained phenomenon is triggering alarm among ecologists and wildlife managers.  Using kayaks, this 3-year project will collect environmental DNA (eDNA) water samples and other field observations from 300 northeastern wetlands to determine muskrat presence/absence, and combine these field data with satellite remote sensing and geospatial analysis/modeling to tackle the science question ""Why are muskrat populations declining?"" in the Northeastern USA, where steep population losses have occurred since the 1980s.  The project will test at least two leading hypotheses for muskrat population decline: 1) widespread invasion of Phragmites (common reed) into wetlands previously dominated by Typha (cattail, a preferred food and habitat for muskrat); and 2) increased variability of water levels from human regulation and/or climate change, and other hypotheses will also be considered.   

Successful candidates will have opportunities to interact with numerous governmental wildlife management and conservation agencies, NASA, and academia.  The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (RIDEM) and USDA National Genomics Center for Wildlife and Fish Conservation are key co-funded partners.  The project has enthusiastic collaborators in State environmental management agencies with partners in 7 States already identified and 4 pending.  Successful candidates will attend annual meetings of the NASA Biodiversity and Ecological Conservation program, and the Northeast Association of Fish & Wildlife Agencies.

Qualifications:  We are seeking candidates enthusiastic about wildlife ecology, conservation, field work, remote sensing, and/or geospatial analysis and modeling.  Applicants for a Postdoctoral Researcher position must demonstrate a strong publication record, a Ph.D. degree in wildlife ecology, biogeography, environmental science, habitat suitability modeling/geospatial analysis/remote sensing, or related field.  Applicants for a Field Technician position must demonstrate successful previous experience organizing, planning, and executing broad-scale field seasons with numerous partners.  Examples of relevant field experience include water sampling, vegetation identification, drone mapping, hydrological measurements, and/or GNSS surveys.  Applicants should also feel comfortable navigating a kayak in the backcountry and working solo or as part of a small team. For either position, there is flexibility with respect to field vs. computational work depending on applicant pool qualifications and interests.  No experience with eDNA is required as successful applicants will receive training for eDNA water sampling from the USDA National Genomics Center for Wildlife and Fish Conservation. 

The anticipated duration of the position(s) is 1-3 years. Salary will be determined by education level (Ph.D., master’s, or baccalaureate degree) and previous experience.  A formal job advertisement is currently under review by Brown University with an anticipated start date in September 2025 (flexible).  For more information, please contact Dr. Laken Ganoe (lsganoe@uri.edu) or Laurence Smith (laurence_smith@brown.edu).

Description
*Applications will be reviewed on a rolling-basis.

USDA Forest Service Office/Lab and Location: A fellowship opportunity is available with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service (FS) within the Pacific Northwest Research Station (PNWRS) and the International Institute of Tropical Forestry. The fellow will be located in the U.S. Southeast.

At the heart of the USDA Forest Service's mission is their purpose. Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency’s mission and motivates their work across the agency. It’s been there from the agency’s very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the USDA Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.

Research Project: The fellow will contribute their PhD-level social science research skills to understand how project planning and coordination, work prioritization, use of existing science, characteristics of the forestry and natural resources workforce, and other factors contribute to implementation success and sustained project outcomes in management actions to improve forest health and resilience. We will focus on select landscape resiliency projects in western and southeastern states and territories associated with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Joint Chiefs’ Landscape Restoration Partnership Program (https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/programs-initiatives/joint-chiefs-landscape-restoration-partnership).

Under the guidance of a mentor, the fellow's participation will help to:

Develop and implement case studies.
Gather qualitative social science data from case study project participants.
Code and analyze collected data.
Report project findings in scientific articles and management-relevant products. 
Learning Objectives: The participant will build their experience conducting the full cycle of social science research, including engaging with natural resource managers and partners about the project, gathering and analyzing social science data, and developing diverse types of science products.

Mentor: The mentors for this opportunity are Eric White (eric.m.white@usda.gov) and Kathleen McGinley (Kathleen.mcginley@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentors.

Anticipated Appointment Start Date: 2025.  Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.

Appointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year but may be extended upon recommendation of USDA Forest Service and is contingent on the availability of funds.

Level of Participation: The appointment is full-time, but part time appointments may be considered. 

Participant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The monthly stipend for full-time participation ranges from $6,500-$7,500.

Citizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents (LPR), and foreign nationals. Non-U.S. citizen applicants should refer to the Guidelines for Non-U.S. Citizens Details page of the program website for information about the valid immigration statuses that are acceptable for program participation. Foreign national candidates may have a mandatory in-person requirement depending on visa status.

ORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and USDA Forest Service. Participants do not become employees of USDA, USDA Forest Service, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits.

Description
Would you like to live in the middle of the Amazon rainforest as part of a fantastic multicultural team while helping to preserve wild macaws? Add to that learning a new set of skills and gaining great field experience at one of the longest-running parrot projects in the Americas? If this sounds good to you, come and join our team of dedicated volunteers!

For over two decades, we’ve been working in the lowlands of southeastern Peru, led by Drs. Brightsmith and Vigo-Trauco from Texas A&M’s Schubot Center for Avian Health. Our research focuses on the breeding ecology of wild parrots and macaws in Tambopata, a region critical to conservation since 1999.

Volunteers are the backbone of our work, contributing thousands of hours to understanding these incredible birds. Whether you’re passionate about wildlife, have a background in biology, or are just eager to gain field experience, we welcome you to be part of this rewarding journey.

With various programs designed for all experience levels—from birdwatching enthusiasts to graduate-level professionals—there’s an opportunity for everyone who’s responsible, enthusiastic, and ready for an adventure in conservation. Are you ready for a hands-on conservation experience in one of the most biodiverse places on Earth? Come join us in making a real difference!

We have different volunteer assistantships programs that require different levels of experience from amateur enthusiasts and birdwatchers to graduate-level professionals. Volunteer activities vary according to the position.

LONG TERM VOLUNTEER ASSISTANT

 Join our team and be trained to identify all local parrots by sight and sound. You’ll conduct parrot censuses in the forest and at clay licks, locate foraging parrots, and enter collected data into our system. During the macaw breeding season, you’ll learn to climb trees using rope systems and observe macaw behavior around nests. Additional duties include campsite setup and cooking. 

SHORT VOLUNTEER ASSISTANT

In this role, you will receive quick training to assist our field team in monitoring macaw nests from the ground, supporting the team that works with ropes. You will also be trained to monitor macaw behavior around nests and help with clay lick observations. Due to the shorter stay, involvement in activities like parrot censuses and tree climbing will be limited. Other responsibilities include campsite setup and cooking. 

SPONSORED LONG TERM VOLUNTEER POSITION

Be part of the “Harrison's Bird Foods Internship in the Rainforest Program”! You will receive comprehensive training similar to our long-term volunteers, including parrot identification, conducting censuses, monitoring foraging behaviors, tracking tree species macaws use, and entering data. In addition to tree climbing and nest observation, you’ll also assist with macaw chick health checks, including taking biometric measurements. You’ll play a key role in our nest monitoring expeditions throughout the Tambopata River basin. As with all positions, activities include campsite setup and cooking. 

QUALIFICATIONS

LONG-TERM VOLUNTEER ASSISTANT REQUIREMENTS:

Volunteers need to be in average physical condition, capable of walking 2 km over moderate terrain. They should have strong observational skills, the ability to remain seated for long periods of time, and a basic knowledge of birds. Travel insurance coverage is also required.

SPONSORED LONG TERM VOLUNTEER POSITION

This position is available immediately, with a start date of November 28, 2024. Candidates must have previous field experience and experience working with birds, along with a degree or be in the final semesters of studies in Biology, Ecology, Forestry, or a related field. Some level of Spanish proficiency is also necessary.

Additional Requirements: Volunteers must be in good physical condition, able to carry a 40 lb (18 kg) pack over moderate terrain for up to 2 km and have no fear of heights (Dec-May). They should have a positive attitude toward facing new and challenging situations, be able to work well in a team under stress and have travel insurance coverage.

ACCOMODATIONS

Our headquarters are located in the Malinoski Biological Station which is located right where the Malinoski river joins the Tambopata River. The station is a two-story wooden house with electricity generated by a gasoline generator and 75 Gb internet. The rooms are for two people and bathrooms and showers are shared. The first floor has a large area for common use of the different teams of researchers who stay there.

COST
Essentially, volunteering is free. We take care of research permit costs, cover the costs of all staff, work to maintain training material, and also deal with all correspondence and various aspects of project management. However, our budget does not extend to being able to pay for all aspects of volunteer participation. As such you only need to cover food, accommodation, and other services provided by the field station. The costs are very reasonable. The daily fee is according to the position and experience:

• Long-term assistant: 30 USD/day 

• Short-term assistant: 45 USD/day 

• SPONSORED Long-term assistant: NO COST (Thanks to the generous sponsorship from Harrison's Bird Foods) 


*A one-time processing fee of $30 will be added for all volunteers.
This rate covers food (3 meals per day) and accommodations (bedding is provided). All volunteers will be charged an airport transfer to be picked up ($20) or dropped off ($10) at the airport plus an extra cost to be transported to the port in private transportation ($45). Once a volunteer was accepted, they will be sent an invoice by email from Texas A&M University. Upon receipt, the volunteer needs to pay 20% of the total cost of their stay. This non-refundable payment is required to hold the reservation for the assistant. The remaining 80% of the payment should be made at least two weeks before the assistant arrives at the release site. Arrangements can be made if assistants wish to pay in cash in the country. However, prior permission from the coordinator is needed. Changes to the daily fee may apply according to availability and season

COLLEGE/UNIVERSITY HIGHLIGHTS
The College of Saint Benedict (CSB), a liberal arts college for women, and Saint John's University (SJU), a liberal arts college for men, are located in the central lakes area of Minnesota, surrounded by more than 3,000 acres of pristine forests, prairies, and lakes. The campuses are minutes away from St. Cloud, an increasingly diverse regional center with a population of over 100,000, and 70 miles from Minneapolis and St. Paul. Some CSB/SJU faculty and staff choose to reside locally, while others commute from the Twin Cities. Both St. Cloud and the Twin Cities offer a wide range of fine arts, cultural, dining, recreational, and sporting opportunities.
 
CSB and SJU are Catholic colleges in the Benedictine tradition enlivened by values of community, hospitality, stewardship, and justice. The schools are dedicated to cultivating an equitable, inclusive community founded on respect for all persons. Students, staff and faculty from many diverse belief systems and backgrounds collectively bring a rich dimension to the academic, cultural, and religious experience at CSB and SJU. We welcome faculty who devote themselves with passion and integrity to their disciplines and to a transformative education of their students.

With a total enrollment of approximately 2,900 students, faculty members develop relationships with students in small classroom settings and have opportunities to work closely with students on research projects, experiential learning experiences, and study abroad programs. Recent initiatives to create a dynamic general education curriculum and to develop plans for a new teaching and learning center demonstrate strong institutional support for faculty development.
 
Institutional Inclusion Visioning Statement
The College of Saint Benedict (CSB) and Saint John’s University (SJU) believe that an excellent liberal arts education requires an understanding and appreciation of cultural difference and that everyone deserves to feel safe and morally valued. To that end, we will challenge our own practices and systems. Our commitment to an inclusive environment will be incorporated into all decision-making processes. We dedicate ourselves to cultivating an equitable, inclusive community founded on respect for all persons.

Description
 USGS Office/Lab and Location: A research opportunity is available with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), located in San Juan, Puerto Rico.

The USGS mission is to monitor, analyze, and predict current and evolving dynamics of complex human and natural Earth-system interactions and to deliver actionable intelligence at scales and timeframes relevant to decision makers. As the Nation's largest water, earth, and biological science and civilian mapping agency, USGS collects, monitors, analyzes, and provides science about natural resource conditions, issues, and problems.

Research Project: The research participant will closely collaborate with the Puerto Rico Coastal Zone Management Program (PRCZMP) within the Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (DNER).  PRCZMP specializes in building and maintaining partnerships to carry out coastal hazard mitigation projects.  In addition, the participant will be mentored by Dr. Legna Torres-García from U.S. Geological Survey, St. Petersburg Coastal and Marine Science Center and local experts including university professors.

Under the guidance of a mentor, the participant will prepare a progress report every three months to document tasks completed, key findings, and any challenges encountered. The participant will present to personnel from the DNER and other invited stakeholders at regular intervals. These presentations will serve as opportunities to gather feedback and ensure that stakeholder perspectives are incorporated throughout the development of the erosion assessment and monitoring protocol.

Learning Objectives: Under the guidance of a mentor the candidate will help in developing a coastal erosion protocol for Puerto Rico. Some of the learning experiences include:

Conduct information research on plans and strategies of agencies (state, federal, and municipal) that work on coastal erosion, specifically focusing on procedures for implementing or searching for solutions to conduct analysis of the coastal erosion rate data and identify high coastal rates areas.
Prepare reports on findings. 
Be a part of meetings with staff from agencies (state, federal, and municipal) that have been identified as involved in or having implemented coastal erosion management in Puerto Rico. 
Learn how to organize logistics for project staff meetings with agencies and municipalities. 
Conduct data and information searches on emergency permits issued by agencies to manage coastal erosion (e.g., DNER, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), among others). 
Learn to develop an information repository where data and procedures related to coastal erosion management are organized and presented. 
Be mentored to complete effective projects.
Mentor: The mentor for this opportunity is Dr. Legna Torres-García (ltorresgarcia@usgs.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor(s). 

Anticipated Appointment Start Date: August 4, 2025. Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.

BAT ECOLOGY, CONSERVATION, & MANAGEMENT METHODS 

COURSE DESCRIPTION -  The conservation of endangered bat species requires an understanding of their unique physiological ecology. Understanding the suite of adaptations that enable bats to occupy their niche provides valuable insight into their demographics, which is a central component of any effective management strategy. This course introduces students to these fascinating and complex mammals. In addition to learning about bat phylogenetics, anatomy, and physiology, which in turn informs their life history and the ecological roles they perform within ecosystems, the course also covers the major threats to bats, basic concepts and protocols for monitoring bat populations in temperate regions, and current strategies for population stabilization and recovery.

Description
The Ecophysiology Lab at the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research and the University of Colorado is seeking a highly motivated and qualified Professional Research Assistant to assist with laboratory set-up and conduct modeling activities related to lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) current and future growth and reproduction projections for populations within Alaska national parks. The initial assignment will be for eighteen months with the possibility of extension pending funding and evaluation. Salary will be commensurate with experience as a Professional Research Assistant. The preferred start date is September 1, 2025. 

The University of Colorado is an Equal Opportunity Employer and complies with all applicable federal, state, and local laws governing nondiscrimination in employment. We are committed to creating a workplace where all individuals are treated with respect and dignity, and we encourage individuals from all backgrounds to apply, including protected veterans and individuals with disabilities.

Key Responsibilities:
Conduct bioenergetics modeling focused on current and future ecosystem stressors such as temperature and food availability in lake systems across Alaska national parks. You will contribute to a regionally applicable model for lake trout across Alaska that may be useful for parks service managers in Alaska and the western United States and assist with the setting up a new laboratory. This work is a collaboration between the University of Colorado-Boulder, the National Parks Service, and the U.S. Geological Survey, within a new lab established by Dr. Peyton Thomas (PI). Primary responsibilities will include: Computer modeling: Compile and analyze environmental, diet, life history data for lake trout populations of interest. We aim to develop a regional Alaska late trout bioenergetics model using Fish Bioenergetics 4.0 that can be used to project future population conditions and provide insight for introduced lake trout populations in other western US National Parks Service units. Therefore, we are looking for a highly motivated individual with experience collecting or using biological data, modeling experience, and experience working with large datasets. General support: This is a brand new lab, so we will begin our lab setup during the time of this PRA! If located in Boulder, beginning in 2026, assist with the setup the new laboratory, including organizing sample archives, research, assemble and maintain equipment, and creating a database of protocols (lab, field, and modeling), and recent field and lab data. Work with PI on obtaining biological permits. Fieldwork: There is a possibility of fieldwork in Lake Clark National Park, AK in Summer 2026 for this position. Here we aim to collect fish morphometric data and tissue samples for an assessment of body condition of multiple life stages to begin model validation. Therefore, we are looking for an individual with fieldwork experience and a willingness to be in remote areas with fishing equipment and handle biological material. Ideally, the candidate will be interested in pursuing a graduate degree at CU-Boulder in 2026 or 2027, but this is not a requirement.

Description
 *Applications will be reviewed on a rolling-basis.

USDA Forest Service Office/Lab and Location: A fellowship opportunity is available with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service (FS) within the International Institute of Tropical Forestry (IITF), located in Río Piedras, Puerto Rico, or remote. 

At the heart of the USDA Forest Service's mission is their purpose. Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency’s mission and motivates their work across the agency. It’s been there from the agency’s very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the USDA Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.

The International Institute of Tropical Forestry (the Institute), headquartered in Río Piedras, Puerto Rico, is a research and technology transfer institute that is dedicated to advancing tropical forestry on insular, national, and international levels, and developing and exchanging knowledge critical to sustaining benefits of tropical forests and grasslands.  The IITF mission is to develop and disseminate scientifically based knowledge that contributes to the conservation of forests, wildlife, and watersheds of the American tropics in the context of environmental change. Current foci include silviculture and forest dynamics, wildfire risk management and forest inventory. The Research and Development mission of the USFS is to develop and deliver knowledge and innovative technology to improve management of the Nation's forests and grasslands—both public and private including National Forest lands.

Proposed Project: The participant will conduct landscape-scale research with existing forest inventory and geospatial data to improve techniques and knowledge in one of three priority areas: forest inventory and analysis, timber production and forest dynamics, or wildfire risk management. The focus will be on mixed species forests of the U.S., including but not limited to subtropical zones. Potential topics include research to improve the precision of forest inventory estimates of trends in timber and non-timber forest products with remote sensing and other geospatial data, or to improve forest management and reduce wildfire risk through improved understanding of the dynamics of economically valuable species and invasive species that may compete with economically valuable species or promote wildfire.

Learning Objectives: The postdoctoral fellow will have the opportunity to apply their experience and knowledge to a new geographic area and set of tree species. They will also have opportunities to present analyses and outputs in workshops, seminars, reports and peer-reviewed publications developed and co-authored with mentors and collaborators. Outputs will be shared with forest managers from industry, the public sector, other landowners and other scientists and land managers.

Mentor: The mentors for this opportunity are  Eileen Helmer (eileen.helmer@usda.gov) and Tamara Heartsill-Scalley (tamara.heartsill-scalley@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentors.

Anticipated Appointment Start Date: August 2025.  Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.

Appointment Length: The appointment will initially be for at least eleven months but may be extended upon recommendation of USDA Forest Service and is contingent on the availability of funds.

Level of Participation: The appointment is full time.

Participant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend at the post-doctoral level is $72,000 (11-months). Additionally, the medical and dental insurance supplement is $6,547, and travel support to present research findings is $2,250. 

Citizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents (LPR), and foreign nationals. Non-U.S. citizen applicants should refer to the Guidelines for Non-U.S. Citizens Details page of the program website for information about the valid immigration statuses that are acceptable for program participation. Foreign national candidates may have a mandatory in-person requirement depending on visa status.

ORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and USDA Forest Service. Participants do not become employees of USDA, USDA Forest Service, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits. Proof of health insurance is required for participation in this program. Health insurance can be obtained through ORISE.

Questions: Please visit our Program Website. After reading, if you have additional questions about the application process please email ORISE.USFS.WO@orau.org and include the reference code for this opportunity.

Qualifications
The qualified candidate should be currently pursuing or have received a doctoral degree in the one of the relevant fields. A candidate with a master's degree in applied statistics is also eligible. Degree must have been received within the past five years or is anticipated to be received by August 31st, 2025.

Description
Are you interested in conducting interesting work in beautiful places? Are you passionate about protecting pristine waterways and natural ecosystems? Would you rather spend more days on a boat than in an office? Well if you answered yes to any of these questions, the Idaho State Department of Agriculture is hiring four Survey Technicians for the Aquatic Invasive Species program. Working out of Post Falls you will have the opportunity to explore some of the most scenic waterways in the continental United States, all while doing critical work to help us protect these special places and building your resume for a future career in natural resources. This is an ideal position for undergraduate students seeking to kick start their career or recent graduates looking to get their foot in the door.

Invasive Species Technicians Primary Responsibilities:

This position offers a hands-on role in protecting Idaho’s waterways through field-based monitoring and response. Invasive Species Technicians conduct surveys for Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS) using established scientific protocols, with much of the work taking place outdoors in dynamic, real-world environments.

Technicians perform a wide range of field sampling and evaluations focused on invasive species and aquatic noxious weeds. Duties include collecting plankton samples for early detection of invasive dreissenid mussels, surveying waterways for aquatic weeds such as Eurasian watermilfoil and flowering rush, and supporting herbicide treatment monitoring by collecting water quality data including herbicide residuals and dissolved oxygen. Technicians also help maintain essential equipment, including hotwash decontamination units.

Fieldwork is a major component of this role and may involve operating motorized boats, paddling kayaks, snorkeling, and hiking along shorelines to complete survey tasks. Some surveys are conducted from both motorized and non-motorized watercraft, and employees must be capable of towing and backing boat trailers safely and confidently.

This position is best suited for individuals who are self-motivated, comfortable working with the public, able to operate independently with limited supervision, and excited about performing physical fieldwork in a variety of outdoor conditions.


Minimum Qualifications: 

The successful applicant must be able to fulfill the following duties:

- Good communication skills
- Ability to pay attention to detail while following established biological sampling protocols
- Work in various types of weather conditions (heat, cold, wind, rain, etc.)
- Work in and around water, mud, and shorelines doing strenuous manual labor with or without a reasonable accommodation
- Ability to lift 50 lbs. with or without a reasonable accommodation
- Possibility of working evenings, weekends, or long hours including occasional overnight stays
- State vehicle usage
- Valid driver’s license

Desired Qualifications

- Experience using GPS for navigation and biological sampling
- Aquatic biology, ecology or field inspection experience
- Pressure washer experience
- Experience with motorboat operation and safety
- Plant identification experience
- Experience working in and around water

Description
We are looking for a Wildlife Biologist to join our team and tackle complex ecological challenges across California.

At WRA, you'll play a key role in supporting a wide range of projects—from ecological restoration and open space management to water and wastewater infrastructure and climate resiliency initiatives. While our work spans the state, this role will primarily focus on projects in the San Francisco Bay and Estuary.

Your work will take you from the coastal salt marshes of the Bay and Pacific Coast, to the grasslands and vernal pools of the Central Valley, and into the Sierra Nevada mountains. As a mid-level professional, we're looking for someone who is motivated, intellectually curious, and eager to learn from our team of experienced biologists. We are especially interested in candidates with experience working with special-status species and a passion for encountering some of the rarest wildlife in the continental United States—while continuing to grow both technically and as a project manager.

You will lead and conduct fieldwork, perform data analysis, and prepare technical reports to support regulatory compliance for restoration, development, and infrastructure efforts. The ideal candidate brings experience with field assessments, permitting with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW), as well as impacts and mitigation evaluations for CEQA and other regulatory approvals.

To be considered for this role, candidates must reside within approximately 45 minutes of our San Rafael, Emeryville, and Petaluma offices. This proximity ensures you can actively contribute to our collaborative team environment and be available for local field site visits as needed.

In this role, you will:
Manage preparation of biological technical reports, restoration/mitigation monitoring reports and species-specific survey reports with oversight and guidance from senior team members 
Conduct CEQA analyses focused on biological resources, including existing condition evaluations, impact assessments, and mitigation recommendations, for IS/MNDs and EIRs
Make ecological management recommendations based on results of ecological surveys and monitoring data
Conduct and lead field surveys for various species and engage with other WRA staff to lead multi-disciplinary field efforts
Collaborate with other technical staff (e.g., biologists, wetland delineators, arborists, GIS specialists) and sub-consultants (e.g., archaeologists, historians) in the completion of technical studies (desktop or field-based)
Work with engineers to review their designs to help avoid and minimize impacts to regulated species, protected aquatic resources and other sensitive areas
Prepare environmental permit applications and technical documents to support inter-agency consultations (e.g., Section 7 of the Federal Endangered Species Act)
Prepare letters, reports, and/or memorandums, which may include detailing results of surveys or assessments
Apply your understanding of the regulatory permitting environment in California to projects
Evaluate project sites for jurisdictional streams and wetlands as well as habitat for special-status species
Collaborate closely with WRA’s senior regulatory permitting specialists and CEQA/NEPA planners to develop environmental scopes of work and budgets
Build and apply skills needed to interact directly with clients and regulatory agencies to manage projects 

To be successful in this role, you will need: 

A Bachelor's or Master's degree in Ecology, Biology, or other Natural Resources-related field
3 years of consulting experience, including direct experience in the identification and ecology of Northern or Southern California wildlife and habitats
Technical knowledge of California's wildlife species, habitats, and applicable state and federal regulations
Experience substantially assisting project managers, and a desire to be mentored in managing WRA’s environmental work
Direct experience working multiple projects and tasks; able to determine project and task urgency in a practical way
Direct experience with aquatic resources permitting and endangered species permitting
Direct experience handling logistics for remote fieldwork (e.g., travel, lodging, equipment, scheduling staff)
Experience in CEQA/NEPA wildlife review and analysis, restoration project land management, and compliance with state and federal requirements during and after project construction
A knack for working independently as well as harmoniously with others
A baseline understanding of Geographic Positioning Systems (GPS) mapping 
To be organized and practice attention to detail
Proficiency in Microsoft Office Suite programs (Word, Excel, PowerPoint) and G-Suite (Gmail, Docs, Sheets, Drive, Calendar, etc.)
A valid driver’s license and reliable transportation (while WRA has fleet vehicles that can be reserved for field use, during busy field seasons a truck may not always be available)
The ability to walk, hike, and work outside for long periods of time
Willingness to learn and participate in tasks outside the specific job role

WRA has an established internal leveling system for our staff that maps to salary bands that have been informed by market data. Our leveling system is dependent on years of relevant industry experience, education, and the level of responsibility and autonomy at which you’re expected to operate.

The salary range for this position is $85,000 - $110,000 which represents 2 job levels that WRA is open to considering for this role. In your first conversation with our recruiter, we will discuss leveling and compensation with you to make sure that expectations are aligned. 

Who are we?
WRA’s an employee-owned environmental consultancy. We are a tenacious team of planners, engineers, and scientists, and we aim to leave the lands we love better than we found them. 

Our clients and partners hire us because we’re skilled at navigating through challenging projects involving wildlands, parks, community spaces, and infrastructure.

Description
Experienced passerine bird bander needed from 13 Aug to 29 Oct to work with a large crew at two high-volume bird banding stations during fall migration. The Michigan State Bird Observatory (MSBO) operates two banding stations, the Burke Lake Banding Station (BULA) and the Corey Marsh Banding Station (CMBS), which are both located near East Lansing, Michigan. The MSBO has three key mission areas: research of avian health and migration, education of current and future ornithological professionals, and outreach for our community. All crew members are expected to contribute to all three mission areas as a core function of their positions.

The stations collectively capture over 6,000 birds per fall field season of 85 – 88 species. Daily captures can exceed 200 birds. Each station opens nets 30 minutes prior to sunrise and closes nets 5 – 5.5 hours post-sunrise (banding often continues later into the morning). BULA has 28 mist-nets and is open 7 days a week, weather permitting, and CMBS has 15 mist-nets and is open 3 days per week. Education and outreach are a key part of our mission; hence, the stations are always open to the public and will host educational programs.

To maintain consistent data collection, there is only one bander at each station per morning. The bander is responsible for efficiently and safely handling all new and recaptured birds. They must have excellent species identification skills – particularly eastern landbirds, which include many ‘confusing fall warblers’. A complete list of species captured can be found on our website. The bander must be able to age birds using skull and molt limits. The bander will be responsible for assessing condition – through scoring of fat stores and muscle, taking morphological measurements, and examining birds for ectoparasites (i.e., ticks). When not banding, the individual will assist with extracting birds from mist-nets and training student assistants in extraction (using body-first method). The bander will work closely each day with 2 data recorders (often volunteers) and must communicate clearly and effectively to maintain accuracy of data collection. Additionally, the bander will need to be a willing and effective communicator with visitors, show visitors birds, share the banding process, and answer questions. Other responsibilities include assisting with the upkeep and maintenance of the study sites (i.e., net and boardwalk repair), assisting with social media posts, and doing data entry. The bander is responsible for getting up 1 – 1.5 hours earlier than net-opening to check weather and make a call on whether there will be a delay in opening nets and communicate with the entire crew via text.The banding season ends on October 15th, but there may be potential opportunities to stay on an additional week to help with data management.

Banders will be part of a crew that each morning includes 1 bander, 2 – 3 mist-net assistants, 1 – 2 students in our mist-netting training assistantship program, 1 outreach specialist, and 1 – 2 volunteer data recorders.

The individual will need to be successfully sub-permitted under Dr. Jen Owen’s Master Banding Permit.

A reliable personal vehicle, valid driver’s license, and auto insurance are required. Hiring is contingent upon passing a background check through Michigan State University.

There are tent-camping (“glamping”) accommodations available at the Corey Marsh Ecological Research Center – including, full bathroom, small indoor and outdoor kitchenettes, and a structure over the tents (which are provided). These are free accommodations with the expectation of all “glamping” crew members contributing to upkeep and cleaning of the spaces used by them.

Desired Qualifications

The bander must have excellent species identification skills – particularly eastern landbirds, which include many “confusing fall warblers”. The bander must be able to age birds using skull and molt limits. The bander will be responsible for assessing condition – through scoring of fat stores and muscle, taking morphological measurements, and examining birds for ectoparasites (i.e., ticks). Additionally, the bander will need to be a willing and effective communicator with visitors, show visitors birds, share the banding process with them, and answer questions. Banders should also have a strong interest in and ability to train our student assistants.

Equal Employment Opportunity Statement

All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, citizenship, age, disability or protected veteran status.

Required Application Materials

Letter of interest detailing relevant experience banding and identifying eastern landbirds. Please also address your interest and qualifications in training in extraction and conducting outreach.
Résumé, including estimated banding and extraction totals
The names, phone numbers, and email addresses of 3 references familiar with your banding experience
Work Hours

o All the work will occur at our field stations, Burke Lake Banding Station in Bath, MI and the Corey Marsh Ecological Research Center in Laingsburg, MI. At least one station is open every day of the week, including weekends. Each workday ranges from 1 hour prior to sunrise and may extend until 2pm (depending on number of birds and weather).

LANDSCAPE PLANNING

COURSE DESCRIPTION -  Conservation planning happens at multiple scales from site-specific to transcontinental. While all conservation actions on the ground must eventually be applied at the site scale, the “landscape-scale” has been recommended for decades as a suitable scale for planning. The landscape scale brings in ecological and socioeconomic context to inform decisions by understanding ecological connections and flows, population-level information about species, human stressors affecting sites but originating outside of them, and policy. This course will explore the key concepts and some tricky challenges of conducting conservation planning at the landscape scale, including how site-scale implementing actions can flow from a landscape-scale plan.  The course will draw on the Conservation Standards and other frameworks but will address the multi-disciplinary needs and tools of landscape planning including spatial analyses and optimization, incorporating socioeconomic factors and community input, the importance of partners, and how to sustain what must be a dynamic effort into the future. Eight guest instructors from multiple organizations around the world will augment the course with their specific expertise and experience.

Description
The Flying A Ranch in Bandera Texas is looking for eager interns to join our staff to assist with our fall hunting season.  Interns will be helping with the day-to-day operations, as well as guiding clients. The ranch is 9,000 acres, with 5,000 of these acres devoted to high quality white-tailed deer management and hunting. This portion of the property is high fenced and is participating in the M.L.D. Program from the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. The remainder of the ranch is focused on exotic ungulate hunting. We have breeding populations of many exotic species, all of which will be hunted each fall.  (axis, fallow, aoudad, sika, kudu, wildebeest etc.) Since our interns will be guiding clients, a strong background in hunting is needed.  Due to many clients booking weekends, as well as weekdays, expect to put in a lot of hours each week. Each intern will be issued a video camera to record animals during scouting, and recordings will be reviewed as a group with ranch staff.   Interns will stay on the ranch, with housing provided, and a truck will be issued for general ranch work and guiding. Interns will be paid monthly, and all guide tips will be split between full time staff and intern guides.

Fall internship / hunting guide duties
Deer blind maintenance
Clearing brush for shooting lanes
Filling feeders
Scouting and videoing animals for future hunts
Guiding hunters
Field dressing harvested animals
Preparing animals for taxidermy
Harvest does and undesirable bucks with MLDP tags

General ranch maintenance

Applicants must have completed a minimum of 60 hours or be a recent graduate of a wildlife or range related field of study. Interns must be able to work alone as well as in groups. A passion for hunting is a must due to the long hours each day and the length of the season.  Guides must be personable, and respectful while guiding all hunts. The internship is from mid-August to mid-January. There is some flexibility with the start and conclusion dates due to different school schedules.  (If mutually agreed upon, at the end of the guiding season, the internship may be lengthened to include our spring internship.) Please send a cover letter, resume, transcript and references via email to apply.  The positions will be filled as soon as quality applications are received.

GEOSPATIAL MODELING WITH QGIS AND R 
 COURSE DESCRIPTION - Analyses of wildlife home range and habitat use are used in wildlife-focused disciplines to inform population and habitat management practices. The geographical space used by animals is largely driven by habitat selection, where habitat can be described by spatially explicit site factors (e.g., land cover). Geospatial modeling is the process of synthesizing geographically referenced field measurements and spatial data layers representing those site factors. In this course, we will process raw point location data, estimate home ranges, and conduct habitat assessments using raster land cover data and the open-source software applications QGIS and R.

Description
 *Applications will be reviewed on a rolling-basis.

NOAA Office/Lab and Location: A research opportunity is currently available with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Ocean Service (NOS), National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS), Stressor Detection and Impacts Division (SDI), Harmful Algal Bloom (HAB) Forecasting Branch located in Kodiak, Alaska. The opportunity is located in Kodiak, Alaska.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) formed the National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS) in 1999 as the focal point for NOAA’s coastal ocean science efforts. NCCOS uses cutting-edge research and high-tech instrumentation to provide citizens, coastal managers, public health officials, and other decision makers with reliable information needed to determine how best to protect environmental resources and public health, preserve valued habitats, and improve the way communities interact with coastal ecosystems. The NCCOS is headquartered in Silver Spring, MD but also has research labs across the nation. The NCCOS also has many assets including research programs, vessels, satellites, science centers, laboratories, and a vast pool of distinguished scientists and experts.

The HAB-F Branch delivers near real-time forecasting products for predicting the intensity/severity, location, and the potential health risk HABs pose in the Great Lakes and coastal regions of the U.S. While national in scope, forecasting efforts and products address regional needs and specific HAB species. The product sets are intended to support coastal resource managers, public health officials, researchers, and the public.

Research Project: Under the guidance of a technical mentor, the selected participant will gain experience in various research activities including performing and otherwise supporting collection of field data, including use of oceanographic monitoring instruments, collection of water, sediment and/or tissue samples and other activities. As well as conducting laboratory studies including toxin analysis, microscopy, molecular methods development and validation, and data analytics. This opportunity will also include engagement with, and training of, stakeholders in Alaska as well as generating outreach materials and technical documentation.

The specific project includes supporting ongoing research efforts in Alaska in support of HAB forecast development. Alaska experiences annual blooms of the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella, as well as other HAB species that can cause shellfish toxicity and vector toxins through the marine food web. There is a need for better monitoring and HAB forecasting products to help mitigate these blooms but much of Alaska is lacking in environmental monitoring data to support a HAB forecasting effort. The overarching goal of this project is to learn about data collection for HAB monitoring, and to help support forecasting data collection to mitigate the impacts of such blooms. This will involve collaborating with a variety of NOAA partners and interacting with stakeholders to support data collection from water, plankton and other biota, collection of environmental data with oceanographic sensors, and supporting laboratory processing of samples for analysis. 

Learning Objectives: The fellow will:

Develop an understanding of Alexandrium blooms, the cause of paralytic shellfish poisoning in Alaska.
Gain familiarity in keeping field data records and collection of data with oceanographic instruments.
Gain familiarity with collection of seawater, plankton, fish and invertebrates for microscopy and toxin analysis.
Gain familiarity with processing samples of seawater, plankton, sediment and biota for analysis.
Gain experience collaborating with diverse sets of partners and stakeholders.
Learn about HAB-F capabilities in monitoring and modeling, including exposure to hydrographic and other field data, and maintaining laboratory and field records.
Mentor: The mentor for this opportunity is Steven Kibler (steve.kibler@noaa.gov), with co-mentor Julie Matweyou (jamatweyou@alaska.edu). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor(s).

 *Applications will be reviewed on a rolling-basis.

USDA Forest Service Office/Lab and Location: A fellowship opportunity is available with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service (FS) within the Pacific Southwest Research Station (PSWRS) located in Placerville, California, or Vallejo, California.

At the heart of the USDA Forest Service's mission is their purpose. Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency’s mission and motivates their work across the agency. It’s been there from the agency’s very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the USDA Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.

Research Project: The primary project focus of the research is to support successful planning for landscape management to enhance risk reduction from wildfire and climate to forests and wildlife. These objectives will be addressed through landscape modeling of a variety of resource conditions and benefits related to forest conditions and as affected by climate change, wildfire, and forest management.  Specific applications will require using ForSys optimization models, FVS models, and using outputs from Landis-II dynamic landscape models.

Decision support tools are becoming essential tools to help organizations and regional and national government agencies with weighing the costs and benefits of actions, assessing optimal solutions based on spatial or nonspatial criteria, or modeling scenarios based on specific assumptions and data. They focus on biophysical and economic outcomes of resource management and restoration, but can also provide guidance in social decision making, governance and negotiation among stakeholders. Decision support tool development and application is another focus of the fellow, which consists of the development of software programs that provide a platform for quantifying and comparing ecological and social costs and benefits, and identifying the existence of patterns and thresholds to inform management and conservation actions across landscapes and over time.  Specific software programs to be used include PROMOTE and the Ecosystem Management Decision Support tool, as well as ForSys Scenario Investment Planning software (e.g., Alan Ager DST).

The fellow is expected to develop and maintain collaborative relationships with scientists and partners in other agencies and institutions and universities.  Skills in balancing the competing demands of multiple simultaneous collaborations will be important for the ultimate success of the fellow. In many cases, the fellow will be a part of a team to develop common data layers that can be used by a suite of scientists from multiple disciplines to understand the complexities of environmental responses to disturbances and change, including retrospective and prospective analyses and researching with spatial analysts and modelers to construct or reconstruct environmental data layers for analysis. Assembles technical information, performs analyses, prepares technical reports, and participates in writing peer-reviewed journal papers, and participates in professional conferences. The fellow will disseminate scientific results through published literature, symposia, presentations, and workshops. 

Learning Objectives: The fellow will be exposed to teams of tenured scientists across diverse disciplines and geographies, and helping to develop products directly relevant and applicable to land management. Through collaborating with scientists from across the country, learning how they approach their science conduct and delivery, and in turn providing innovative ideas and collaboration in science delivery.  They will collaborate with scientists across California, building a strong network of colleagues and partners in future research activities. They will collaborate with a wide array of State and Federal agency managers, learning about the challenges that they face and how research and science delivery can help support their research. They will research with decision support tool development, and learn about how DSTs can best meet the need of putting complex scientific information in the hands of managers in a readily accessible and defensible manner. 

Mentor: The mentor for this opportunity is Pat Manley (patricia.manley@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor.

Anticipated Appointment Start Date: March 2025.  Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.

Appointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year but may be extended upon recommendation of USDA Forest Service and is contingent on the availability of funds.

Level of Participation: The appointment is full time.

Participant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend range is $4,000 to $6,000 per month.

Citizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents (LPR), and foreign nationals. Non-U.S. citizen applicants should refer to the Guidelines for Non-U.S. Citizens Details page of the program website for information about the valid immigration statuses that are acceptable for program participation.

It is divided into seven uniquely different administrative units. Six of the units are referred to as “ranger districts” and one is a “national recreation area.” Located in northeastern Nevada, the Ruby Mountains area is composed of rocky peaks, glacier-formed lakes, steep narrow canyons, and rolling hills.

Description
WRA is seeking a Landscape Architecture Director to lead our Landscape Architecture Group within our interdisciplinary Riverscapes and Shorelines Team. The desired candidate will collaborate and engage both internally and externally to lead, support, and deliver a diverse range of design projects focused primarily on ecological restoration, with the capability to support parks and open space and community resilience projects as needed.  

You will join our team of restoration design professionals and scientists, including engineers, landscape architects, fluvial geomorphologists, hydrologists, and ecologists. Our projects span a variety of ecosystems and types across California including San Francisco Bay tidal marshes and living shorelines, Sierra Nevada meadow restoration, Northern California Coast floodplain and salmonid restoration, California Central Coast estuary restoration, and Bay Area and Southern California urban stream rehabilitation. Additionally, our team is actively growing and pursuing restoration work in Oregon. We are passionate about restoring riverine and coastal systems that support healthy and resilient natural and human communities, and are invested in the entire restoration process from initial site selection to performance monitoring and adaptive management. We also frequently collaborate with our parks and open space and community resilience teams to integrate ecological restoration with recreation and educational opportunities such as trails, gathering spaces, and interpretive features, as well as tackling challenges such as sea-level rise and wildfire resiliency.

WRA has a diverse portfolio of projects and clients, including decades-long private clients, public agencies, and non-profit organizations. In addition to our technical expertise, we help clients meet their goals and visions by providing grant fund cultivation, preparing financial models, partnering with investors, engaging stakeholders, and facilitation services. 

We envision you working in-person at one of our San Francisco Bay Area offices or in a hybrid arrangement or remote location in this region of California. Other locations may be considered on a case by case basis. Regardless of your work arrangement, in-person, remote, or hybrid, you will be excited to collaborate with staff in many technical disciplines across the company.

At WRA, you will have 3 major areas of impact:

Technical Skills:
Provide guidance on the design strategy for seasonal wetland, tidal wetland, river, and riparian restoration projects
Oversee the production of conceptual plans, construction drawings, technical specifications, and cost estimates for use in all design phases.
Apply knowledge of California native plant communities, soils, hydrology, and construction in restoration planning and design.
Provide construction administration and management services, including field observation of grading, planting, and other landscape design components.

Leadership:
Utilize restoration experience to provide technical oversight of restoration conceptual plans, construction drawings, specifications, cost estimates, and relevant soil and hydrologic analyses.
Mentor landscape architects and designers in grading, planting, irrigation, and restoration design using AutoCAD and Civil 3D software.
Oversee project managers and design staff to ensure work quality and that projects meet budgets and deadlines.
Foster collaboration within an interdisciplinary team.

Business Development:
Develop regional recognition through networking and events, such as attending and presenting at conferences.
Advise clients on project issues to build business.
Lead and support new proposal efforts.

To be successful in this role, you will need: 

To be currently licensed as a Landscape Architect in the U.S. with the ability to obtain California licensure within 6 months of hiring.  
Minimum of 10 years’ experience providing landscape architectural services with demonstrated success designing and implementing seasonal wetland, tidal wetland, river and/or riparian restoration.  
Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in landscape architecture at a university or college that is accredited by the Landscape Architectural Accreditation Board.
Strong written and verbal communication abilities.  
A passion for ecological restoration and connecting people from diverse backgrounds and locations with the outdoors and open spaces. 
Familiarity with California ecosystems and regulatory environment.
Experience supervising and mentoring junior staff. 
Experience developing a portfolio of work.
A valid driver’s license and reliable transportation (while WRA has fleet vehicles that can be reserved for field use, during busy field seasons a truck may not be available).

WRA has an established internal leveling system for our staff that maps to salary bands that have been informed by market data. Our leveling system is dependent on years of relevant industry experience, education, and the level of responsibility and autonomy at which you’re expected to operate.

We have posted a salary range that corresponds to the appropriate level for this position. In your first conversation with our recruiter, we will discuss leveling and compensation with you to make sure that our expectations are aligned.

Description
Employment is contingent upon successful completion of a background check.
 Our Organization:
 The FWC envisions a Florida where fish and wildlife are abundant and thriving in healthy and connected natural landscapes with vital working lands and waterways; where natural resources are valued and safely enjoyed by all; and wherein natural systems support vibrant human communities and a strong economy.
Our Mission: Managing fish and wildlife resources for their long-term well-being and the benefit of people.
Every organization has an identity that is forged not only by what it does, but by how it conducts itself.  The values embedded in our mission and expressed in the vision of the FWC are to make quality decisions by being dynamic, science-informed, efficient, ethical, collaborative and committed to the vitality of the state and its environment.
 Description of Duties:
 This is a rewarding and challenging opportunity to contribute to landscape-level conservation objectives and benefit a wide variety of rare and imperiled species and their habitats across the State of Florida.  This position serves as a biologist in the Land Use Planning (LUP) Program in the Division of Habitat and Species Conservation’s Office of Conservation Planning Services (CPS).  Biologists in the LUP Program gain in-depth knowledge of Florida's environmental regulations and their practical applications, serve the public, and develop an enhanced understanding of listed species habitats and life histories while helping to shape a sustainable future in Florida.  LUP biologists work as part of a talented and diverse team and coordinate with wildlife experts throughout the Agency.
 CPS provides technical assistance to a wide array of private and public sector landowners and local, state, and federal governmental entities on conservation-related issues.  The LUP Program coordinates collaborative consultations for land use planning efforts that have the potential to impact fish and wildlife resources, particularly those that anticipate going through a regulatory process (Environmental Resource Permits, Section 404, Siting Coordination, County Comprehensive Plan amendments, major watershed initiatives, etc.).  This position will provide technical assistance to stakeholders and partner agencies for land use planning activities and is responsible for tracking, reviewing, and commenting on a variety of applications related to changes in land use and environmental permitting.  This position is unique within the team of LUP biologists; in addition to the typical duties, it allows for opportunities to work with Landowner Assistance Program biologists, broad exposure to Agency personnel and programs, and contact with key stakeholders.
 To excel in this role, the successful candidate must have an understanding of fish and wildlife ecology and management needs, as well as a practical knowledge of native habitat management and recovery techniques suited to various Florida landscapes.  Proficiency in technical writing and the use of GIS software is essential, and candidates will be expected to demonstrate these skills during the interview process.  Ideal candidates will have mastered these knowledge, skills, and abilities.
 Much of the work in this position will be conducted from an office during regular business hours, and biologists in the LUP Program enjoy a relatively predictable work schedule with the flexibility to attend site visits or assist other FWC staff in the field when appropriate.  Occasional long days and overnight travel are expected.  Agency supported and individual-specific training will be made available to the person in this position as needed. 

 The position is responsible for timely and accurate processing and or approval, as appropriate, of vendor invoices and warrants for payment of goods received or services rendered to avoid automatic interest penalty payments to said vendors.  It is responsible for adhering to the provisions and requirements of Section 215.422, F.S., related to State Comptroller’s rules, as well as Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission invoice processing and warrant distribution procedures.  Responsibilities may include legislative interactions.  The position is expected to courteously assist Commission constituents to resolve questions or problems they may have in matters relating to the Commission, its programs or fish and wildlife conservation, generally.  It is expected to actively garner public support for agency objectives and programs by serving Florida’s citizens in a positive and proactive manner.
Requirements: Employment is contingent upon successful completion of a background check. Eligible candidates must possess and maintain a valid Driver’s License.

Minimum Qualifications:

Five years of relevant experience. A Bachelor’s degree in a relevant field can substitute for four of the five years of required experience.  Candidates must have experience writing and reviewing technical documents, must have experience with imperiled species or their habitats, and should be familiar with land use applications and/or permits.  Above all, the successful applicant will be enthusiastic, self-motivated, organized, and have a commitment to natural resource conservation and excellence in customer service.

Description
Purpose: 

Southeast Conservation Corps (SECC) is a non-profit, AmeriCorps-affiliated organization. This individual placement is in partnership with the National Park Service and is an AmeriCorps Position. SECC empowers young adults to cultivate compassion, responsibility, and grit through community service, and environmental stewardship. SECC selects young adults, ages 18-30, to complete conservation projects on public lands throughout the Southeast. SECC programs encourage environmental stewardship, foster community partnerships, and emphasize experiential learning. SECC serves a diverse population that is representative of the Southeast, including youth, graduates, veterans, and a cross-section of ethnicities and income levels. 

Congaree National Park is the largest intact expanse of old-growth bottomland hardwood forest remaining in the southeastern United States. Waters from the Congaree and Wateree Rivers sweep through the floodplain, carrying nutrients and sediments that nourish and rejuvenate this ecosystem and support the growth of national and state-champion trees. The National Park Service preserves unimpaired the natural and cultural resources and values of the National Park System for the enjoyment, education, and inspiration of this and future generations. The National Park Service cooperates with partners to extend the benefits of natural and cultural resource conservation and outdoor recreation throughout this country and the world.

Position Overview:

The team will have a direct positive impact on Congaree by performing restoration efforts in a National Park. Their actions will directly promote the restoration, well-being, and conservation of wetlands, longleaf pine ecosystems, and rare species. This project supports multiple high-priority activities outlined in the 2021 CONG Resource Stewardship Strategy. Wild pig management will include work with NPS staff and USDA partners on (a) trap site mapping, monitoring (w/ wildlife cameras), surveying for destruction, prioritization, and baiting, and (b) trap assessment, maintenance, and relocation. Interns will not handle firearms. Interns will receive training in park operations, seasonal safety, hog management, and wilderness management while gaining field experience and learning to work as a team. 

The intern will complete surveys for feral hogs and present the data to the park at the end of their term. The intern will hopefully detect patterns of hog movement, hotspots, and areas of high impact. Feral hog destruction is the most destructive force within Congaree, impacting the entire park (27,000 acres). The intern's work will directly improve park conditions by assisting law enforcement with invasive hog removal, mapping, and ecosystem restoration.

 

Description of Duties: 

Feral Hog Management 

·       Survey Park for feral hogs, destruction, and signs, pinpointing where populations are present and mapping it using GIS

·       Locate feral hog hot spots within the Park.

·       Determine patterns of feral hog movement within the season based on pressures, food supply, etc.

·       Assist managers with baiting, trapping, and data collection.  

Potential environmental/human risk involved with the above service: Hiking several miles in remote terrain, serving outdoors in hot, humid, cold, rain, snow, or other conditions, potential exposure to ticks, mosquitoes, black bears, snakes, hog, and other wildlife, operating government vehicles, and working alongside law enforcement (firearms).

Description
At RES, we’re looking for purpose-driven individuals who are passionate about restoration and sustainability, and who want their work to make a lasting environmental impact. Our team members go above and beyond, bringing initiative, integrity, and a strong work ethic to every project. Collaboration is key—we thrive on teamwork, open communication, and diverse perspectives. In a field that constantly changes, we value those who are resilient, adaptable, and resourceful in the face of challenges. If you're intellectually curious, eager to learn, and ready to help restore ecosystems and protect natural resources, you’ll find your place here.

RES is looking for a Scientist I (Part-Time) to join our team.

As a Scientist I at RES, you’ll support field data collection, environmental monitoring, and ecological assessments that form the foundation of our restoration and mitigation projects. Working under the direction of experienced scientists and project managers, you’ll contribute to meaningful work in the field—collecting and processing data, supporting reporting efforts, and gaining exposure to environmental regulations, ecosystems, and scientific best practices.

This is an entry-level opportunity ideal for a recent graduate or someone early in their career who is passionate about environmental science, ecology, or natural resources and wants to build a strong foundation for long-term growth. In addition to the Scientist 1 duties defined, this role will also include some Assistant Project Management functions on project sites as needed. 

This position is based in our Orlando, FL office, and the selected candidate is expected to work from the office occasionally as needed. Approximately 70–80% of your time will be spent in the field, supporting current projects in Polk County and surrounding areas. This role will require about 30 hours a week initially with the potential to grow in to a full time role. Weekly scheduling may consist of 3 longer hour days or or 4-5 days M-F with shorter hours based on project needs. Occasional out-of-town travel may be required for project support across Florida, though this is expected to be limited.

Why You’ll Love This Job

You’ll be in the field, not just behind a desk. Whether you’re taking soil samples, surveying stream banks, or recording vegetation data, you’ll see firsthand the ecosystems you’re helping to restore.

You’ll build real-world scientific skills. From GPS data collection to interpreting maps and recording results, you'll apply and expand your environmental knowledge daily.

You’ll grow with mentorship. You’ll work side-by-side with senior scientists, field leads, and project managers who are invested in helping you learn and succeed.

Your work will have an impact. The data you collect will guide decisions that shape the future of restored wetlands, streams, and habitats across your region.

 
A Day in the Life

Your day might start at a project site—walking transects through a wetland, recording plant species, and using GPS to mark key locations. You’ll work as part of a small field team, following sampling protocols, maintaining equipment, and ensuring every data point is accurate and well-documented. Later, you might return to the office to enter your data into Excel or another database, help process site photos and maps, or contribute notes for a technical report.

You’ll learn how environmental regulations influence what we do, and begin to understand how habitat, water quality, and landscape features intersect in project planning. Over time, you’ll become more familiar with regional flora and fauna, permitting frameworks, and the real-world application of scientific principles in the field.

We would like to talk to you if you have many of the following:

Bachelor’s degree in environmental science, biology, ecology, geology, natural resources, or a related field
0–2 years of field experience (can include internships, academic fieldwork, or volunteer work)
Basic knowledge of scientific methods, data collection using GPS and/ or GIS tools, and safe field practices
Familiarity with ecological concepts such as native species, soil profiles, or hydrology
Ability to work outdoors in varying conditions and terrain

You will thrive in this position if you:

Possess strong written communication skills for data documentation and reporting
Have attention to detail and a commitment to high-quality data collection
Have strong work ethic and reliability in team-based fieldwork
Organized, curious, and eager to grow into a leadership role
Comfortable communicating with technical and non-technical stakeholders

What would make you stand out?

Exposure to wetland, stream, or habitat assessments
Experience with field sampling equipment, inventories, or monitoring protocols
Understanding of regional environmental regulations and permitting
 

Please note that the “Day in the Life” section is not intended to be an exhaustive list of job duties, but rather a representative snapshot of typical responsibilities and work experiences at RES.

Description
OVERVIEW:
The laboratory of Nina Overgaard Therkildsen at Cornell University is seeking a highly motivated postdoctoral to lead a project exploring the use of DNA-based methods to monitor lower food web dynamics. Quantifying zooplankton diversity and abundance is vital for monitoring ecosystem health, but traditional methods based on microscopy are labor-intensive and often provide limited taxonomic resolution. Metabarcoding offers promise of faster, cheaper, more accurate, and higher-resolution characterization of zooplankton biodiversity. However, these methods can be limited by primer biases, incomplete reference databases, and challenges in accurately reflecting organismal biomass. Shotgun metagenomics - sequencing all DNA present in a sample without the need for targeted amplification - may provide a more comprehensive and unbiased view of community composition. This approach has the potential to offer a more accurate estimate of relative abundance, but its performance and practicality for application on complex real-world tissue mixtures has not yet been validated. Accordingly, both metabarcoding and metagenomic approaches will need careful context-specific evaluation and benchmarking against traditional approaches prior to any large-scale implementation in monitoring programs. This position offers the exciting opportunity to assess the performance of these emerging techniques in a real-world monitoring program and help shape the future of aquatic ecosystem assessment.
 KEY RESPONSIBILITIES:
The project will generate side-by-side comparisons of results from metabarcoding, metagenomics, and traditional microscopy on samples collected by the Hudson River Lower Food Web Monitoring Program. The postdoc is expected to lead efforts in the following five areas:
·      Design and refine experimental and laboratory protocols for DNA extraction and library preparation from bulk tissue and water samples
·      Analyze high-throughput sequencing data and optimize bioinformatic pipelines for both metabarcoding and metagenomic workflows
·      Build and curate taxonomic reference databases from public repositories and de novo sequencing
·      Collaborate with partners and regional stakeholders and co-organize annual workshops to promote knowledge exchange
·      Prepare peer-reviewed publications and presentations for both scientific and broader audiences
 DESIRED QUALIFICATIONS:
·      A Ph.D. in molecular ecology, bioinformatics, evolutionary biology, environmental genomics, or a related field
·      Demonstrated experience with metabarcoding, metagenomics, or other environmental DNA applications
·      Proficiency in programming and bioinformatics tools for high-throughput sequence analysis
·      Excellent organizational skills, attention to detail, and ability to work both independently and collaboratively in a team environment.
·      Strong written and verbal communication skills
·      Commitment to fostering an inclusive and supportive research environment
            TERMS OF APPOINTMENT:
This is a full-time position starting in late summer 2025 (or as soon as possible thereafter). The initial appointment is for 12 months, with the potential for renewal based on performance and available funding. The position will be based in Ithaca, NY, in the Department of Natural Resources and the Environment at Cornell University. While on-site work is preferred, we offer some flexibility. Salary will be commensurate with experience and competitive. Our lab and Cornell University are committed to fostering a diverse, equitable, and inclusive environment.

JOB TITLE:   Field Technician

JOB PURPOSE:  We are seeking technicians to work on a research project on Oʻahu, Hawai’i as part of the Hawai’i V.I.N.E. (Vertebrate Introductions and Novel Ecosystems) project, a collaboration across multiple universities (UH Manoa, UW, NAU, and UIUC) that began in 2014. The project is investigating temporal changes in seed dispersal and how removal of dominant invasive plants alters seed dispersal in mesic and wet forest ecosystems. Native species extinctions and non-native species introductions have dramatically changed the forest species composition. Although many native plants depend on birds for seed dispersal, on Oʻahu there are no longer any native frugivorous birds to provide this function. Instead, a suite of non-native birds are dispersing seeds. Additionally, invasive plants often dominate seed dispersal networks with impacts to native plant seed dispersal. Understanding temporal changes and how removal of invasive plant species impacts seed dispersal is critically important for restoration efforts.

There are multiple positions open with starting dates spanning August to November, with a minimum of a five-month commitment. 

ESSENTIAL DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES:  Basic duties include: (1) conducting mist-netting of birds to collect fecal samples for diet analysis, (2) performing point counts for bird abundance, (3) bird and plant ID, (4) measuring fruit abundance, (5) measuring vegetation characteristics, (6) removing access to non-native fruit, and (7) deploying game cameras. Additional duties will include: (1) regularly checking and maintaining netting and other experimental setups, (2) ensuring accurate and consistent data recording and entry, (3) collaborating with team members for data analysis and interpretation, and (4) participating in team meetings and contributing to project planning and adjustments. Additionally, applicants will be expected to participate in regular (at least monthly) outreach and education events related to the project. 

The candidate(s) selected for this position will work on a field crew of 6-9 people including other technicians, crew leader, and graduate students. Technicians must be able to work early mornings in rugged terrain in challenging field conditions. Fieldwork will involve long days of hiking and temperamental weather conditions. This is a full-time position and technicians will receive effective compensation of $14/hour, plus shared access to vehicles and the option to live in crew housing. Further details will be provided during interviews. Applicants will be responsible for their flight to Daniel K. Inouye International Airport (HNL) in Honolulu, Hawaii.

QUALIFICATIONS: Minimum: A bachelor’s degree in biology, natural resources, wildlife management, botany, ecology or a related field and field experience pertaining to wildlife biology or botany are required. Applicants must be responsible, organized, and comfortable living and working as a team. An enthusiasm for research and fieldwork is essential, as well as patience and a strong work ethic. Valid driver's license with a motor vehicle record (MVR) that is compliant with the University Vehicle Use Policy. Desired: Preference will be given to applicants with experience in tropical ecosystems, avian ecology, plant ecology, and/or a demonstrated knowledge of Hawaiian plants. 

REQUIRED MATERIALS: Complete the online application. Applications must include a cover letter, curriculum vitae, and contact information (email and phone) for 3 references familiar with your field work experience as a single PDF document. Review of applications will begin June 9, 2025. Applications for this round of hiring will not be accepted after September 1, 2025. In your cover letter, please specify your desired start date. Include details of any prior experience in bird banding, such as the approximate number of birds you have banded and extracted. Additionally, highlight any experience with plant identification and/or systematic vegetation surveys.

Description
Florida International University (FIU) and Everglades National Park (ENP) seek a postdoctoral researcher.

Duration: 2.5 years
Start date: Open until filled
Annual Salary: $61,000 - $64,000 (+ benefits package)
Location: Flexible (If in person, the position is based in Miami, FL)

About the position: FIU and the National Park Service’s South Florida Natural Resources Center (SFNRC) seek a talented and enthusiastic postdoctoral researcher with excellent quantitative skills to lead research aimed at gaining a comprehensive understanding of the resilience of Everglades recreational fisheries to hydroclimatic variation and extreme events. Recreational fishing is a core socioeconomic activity in the region, with 1 in 5 Florida anglers fishing the coastal Everglades and generating billions in economic activity. Yet, our understanding of the patterns of recreational catch and effort and their dependency on hydrology, including ongoing restoration efforts, and climate remains limited.

Coastal fisheries are hypothesized to respond to both press and pulse disturbances, with pulse disturbances impacting recruitment events and press disturbances regulating overall population performance. Thus, the goals of the study, using fisheries dependent an environmental data, are threefold: 1) To examine spatiotemporal patterns in angler catch and effort in the Everglades recreational fishery, 2) To link these spatiotemporal trends to hydroclimatic drivers and restoration actions, and 3) To evaluate the utility of fisheries-dependent data and provide recommendations for future monitoring. Available data sets include a dockside angler survey that spans over 40 years and is one of the longest and most valuable fisheries-dependent datasets in Florida, along with hydrological and climate data streams.

The position provides a unique opportunity to work collaboratively in an academic institution-government agency partnership with the goal of increasing our understanding of coastal processes and restoration effects and of improving recreational fisheries management. We are part of a highly collaborative South Florida research community, composed of scientists, federal, state, private partners, and stakeholders (see http://fcelter.fiu.edu/ and https://crestcache.fiu.edu/), and thus opportunities for collaborative team science, participation in other projects, engagement with resource managers and anglers, and mentoring graduate and undergraduate students are available.

Requirements: A Ph.D. in ecology, fisheries, quantitative ecology, biology, or related field is required. Applicants must have a demonstrated record of publication in peer-reviewed journals, and excellent coding skills in R. The selected candidate must pass a U.S. government tier 1 (non-sensitive) background check and complete NPS cybersecurity training. This position requires frequent in-person work at both FIU and NPS offices in Miami, FL.

Preferred qualifications: The ideal candidate has excellent quantitative skills and a passion for fisheries. Experience and interest working with fisheries-dependent data, robust causation analytical approaches, stock assessment tools, using collaborative team science approaches, and engagement with anglers and resource managers are desired.

How To Apply: Please email Dr. Jenn Rehage at rehagej@fiu.edu and Dr. Rolando Santos rsantosc@fiu.edu with the subject line ‘Postdoc 2025 + your name.’ In your email, please include (as a single PDF):

Description
Centro de Rescate de Especies Marinas Amenazadas (CREMA) operates a multifaceted approach for the conservation of endangered marine species at several beaches Southern Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica. In our sea turtle nesting program, which opens annually during the Olive Ridley nesting season (June – January), we conduct beach monitoring (night patrols and morning censuses), nest relocations into project hatcheries, environmental education activities, and help on the environmental awareness with the local and international community, that also helps on generating job opportunities for the locals and promoting sustainable tourism development. Olive Ridleys (Lepidochelys olivacea) is the most frequent and main species that nest on these beaches, but there is also sporadic nesting of Green (Chelonia mydas), Leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea), and Hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata) sea turtles. Egg poaching is a major threat to the nesting sea turtles on these beaches. Secondary threats include nest predation, plastic pollution, beach development and erosion, and tourist traffic. On the beaches, CREMA directs all our efforts to prevent and ultimately decrease these threats.
We operate a multifaceted approach for the conservation of sea turtles, including; applying several scientific methodologies on field, conduct beach patrols, hatchery management, conduct climate change impact protocols, develop environmental education activities, and awareness with the local community, generating job opportunities for the locals, and promoting sustainable tourism development.

Chagar Hutang Turtle Sanctuary (Malaysia)
Description
The Sea Turtle Research Unit (SEATRU) has been working to protect endangered green and hawksbill turtles nesting at the Chagar Hutang Sea Turtle Sanctuary for over 30 years. SEATRU’s dedicated work to conserve one of Malaysia’s most important nesting sites has helped to increase the number of successful nests laid at Chagar Hutang to over 2,000 each year. Beyond monitoring nesting turtles and ensuring hatchlings emerge from their nests, SEATRU’s grassroots conservation efforts have helped to protect the natural beauty of this remote island location – think crescent-shaped palm-fringed beach, lush tropical jungle, and vibrant coral reefs. 

SEATRU's main goal is the long-term monitoring and conservation of nesting turtles at our Chagar Hutang site. We work closely with experienced local rangers to help guide our nesting beach monitoring programs. In addition, Chagar Hutang serves as a natural laboratory for postgraduate students and undergraduate interns to carry out a variety of independent research projects at the site. With over 2,000 nests laid at the beach between April and October each year, Chagar Hutang can be a busy place after dark, with mother turtles coming and going through all hours of the night. 

To help us locate every nest, SEATRU runs an annual volunteer program to assist our rangers with their nighttime turtle monitoring efforts. Once a week during the nesting season, different groups of volunteers join our project to live and work together, and to experience grassroots sea turtle conservation efforts and the local island lifestyle at our remote sea turtle sanctuary site. Our program’s volunteers come from diverse backgrounds throughout Malaysia and abroad and often share how their experiences at Chagar Hutang were a ‘once-in-a-lifetime’ event. 


Duties: 

Interns will work closely alongside SEATRU’s Conservation Rangers at Chagar Hutang to lead volunteer groups in collecting data on nesting sea turtles, marking nest sites, and performing nest checks to monitor the health of hatchlings and ensure their emergence success. Interns are responsible for correctly and accurately managing nesting data, including compiling nesting data from night patrol into handwritten logbooks at the research station. Interns help direct and assist volunteers in food preparation, station upkeep, and outdoor activities, like jungle trekking, kayaking, and snorkeling. Furthermore, SEATRU interns regularly engage with public tourists visiting the nesting beach for educational day trips or assist with school group camping trips. 

Interns will learn how to: 

·         Identify sea turtle tracks, including false crawls, nesting attempts, and successful nests. 
·         Measure a nesting turtle’s carapace, apply and read identification tags, and conduct photo ID. 
·         Mark a nest site, complete individual nesting data forms, and manage data records in the field. 
·         Excavate nests to inventory hatching and emergence success, and release baby sea turtles. 
·         Educate the public about the threats sea turtles face and how we can work to conserve them. 
·         Lead diverse groups of people, challenge themselves, and make new friends. 

Interns will receive preliminary training by SEATRU staff before the start of the internship, and support from rangers and staff throughout their stay. However, fieldwork can be strenuous. Night patrols require walking between nesting turtles across soft beach sands. During the day, there is the risk of sun exposure as Malaysia is a tropical country, with hot and humid weather conditions, frequent showers, and thunderstorms. 

Private same-sex housing is provided for interns at the Chagar Hutang Research Station, however, the kitchen, office and common-use areas are open to the surrounding environment, including the insects, geckos, and spiders that live there. Chagar Hutang's pristine natural environment is also home to many beautiful birds, curious monkeys, and unique species of snakes and lizards. Furthermore, Chagar Hutang's coral reefs host a multitude of colorful and diverse tropical fish, friendly reef sharks, and resident turtles. 

 Requirements: 

·         College students or recent graduates who are responsible, adaptable, motivated to learn, and passionate about marine conservation. 
·         Must be able to perform physically demanding work, including but not limited to walking long distances in soft sand, handling high temperatures, humidity, stormy weather, and insects, withstanding exposure to intense sunlight, kneeling and digging in hot/heavy/wet sand, and carrying up to 30 lbs. 
·         A commitment to participate in the program for at least 8 weeks, though longer (12-16 weeks) is preferred. 
·         International applicants must have or obtain a valid passport and purchase international travel insurance to cover the duration of their time in Malaysia. 
·         A minimum of 18 years of age and engaged in or recently completed undergraduate studies. 

 Benefits/Costs: 

There is no direct compensation for the SEATRU internship position. However, interns may receive a small stipend depending on their overall performance at the end of their internship period. Interns will be responsible for their transportation, international and domestic, to SEATRU’s office located at Universiti Malaysia Terengganu in Kuala Terengganu, Peninsular Malaysia. Transportation to and from the Chagar Hutang Research Station on Redang Island, as well as room and board while staying at the station, will be compensated by SEATRU. 

 Application/Contact Information: 

To apply, please email your cover letter, detailing your interest in a Sea Turtle Conservation Internship position with SEATRU, along with your resume or CV and two references’ contact information to turtle@umt.edu.my.

Gulf Specimen Marine Lab and Aquarium is a nonprofit with a mission of educating the public about our oceans to create good stewards of our ocean ecosystems. We are a public aquarium open almost every day of the year with thousands of gallons of saltwater aquarium displays. Organisms on display include sea turtles, stingrays, sharks, octopus, a large touch tank room and more. GSML is also a marine life educational facility with thousands of guests visiting for guided tours each year. For over fifty years we have functioned as a biological supply to universities and aquariums supplying live organisms for research and education purposes only. We are also one of the oldest sea turtle rehabilitation facilities in operation.  
 We are looking to fill three positions for six-month internships with housing and utilities provided.

At a public aquarium everything that the public can see is part of the display and needs to be neat, clean, orderly and professional looking. All the areas behind the scenes need to be neat, clean, orderly and professional looking to function. If you do not agree with the statement “if a task needs doing, it is in my job description” please do not apply for this internship.  
Our marine life educational programs involve conducting marine life educational tours. You will need to be comfortable with public speaking.

Purpose — About Southeast Conservation Corps (SECC):   
Empowering youth and adults to cultivate compassion, responsibility and life skills through community service, hard work and land stewardship.    
 SECC, a program of Conservation Legacy, is a non-profit AmeriCorps program. We engage youth (age 15-17) and young adults (ages 18-30, up to 35 for veterans) in service projects on public lands throughout the Southeast. Our AmeriCorps positions provide impactful educational and service opportunities that benefit both communities and landscapes. SECC’s participants reflect the population of the Southeast region, including youth, graduates, veterans, and individuals from various ethnic and economic backgrounds.  
 SECC collaborates with land management agencies such as the United States Forest Service, National Park Service, State Parks, local municipalities, and non-profits to host day and camping crews. Our projects vary but include trail construction and maintenance, restoration of natural areas, invasive species removal, fire fuels reduction, fencing, herbicide applications, and more. Most projects involve strenuous manual labor and require hiking to and from the project sites daily, carrying tools and day packs.   
    SECC camping crews serve in frontcountry and backcountry locations, often in challenging weather conditions. While hitch schedules vary by project and location, they typically follow a 9-day on, 5-day off pattern, with 10-hour shifts and scheduled breaks throughout the day. While we aim to maintain consistency, flexibility is expected as schedules, times, and project locations are subject to change based on project needs.      
    SECC is an independent, non-residential program, and crew members are responsible for securing their own housing when not in the field. On-hitch, crews manage camp chores and prepare all their own meals, with evenings often including group discussions. Members must provide their own personal outdoor gear (e.g., tent, sleeping bag, sleeping pad, day pack, multi-day pack, work pants, hiking/work boots), while SECC provides group camp equipment, tools, protective gear and transportation between SECC Office and project sites.   
    Description of Duties — Position Summary 

Southeast Conservation Corps (SECC) Strike Team has partnered with a range of land managers across the Southeast, including the U.S. Forest Service at Bankhead National Forest, The Nature Conservancy (TNC) in South Carolina, and Tennessee State Parks. This multi-agency initiative is rooted in a shared commitment to restoring land integrity, enhancing visitor experiences, and preparing young adults for careers in conservation. 


Crews should anticipate some hitches in rugged backcountry conditions and will be camping in remote, primitive settings to complete essential conservation projects.  


 


Service Project: 

Members of the Strike Team should expect a wide array of land management projects. During their time in the field, crew members camp overnight and serve outdoors in all weather conditions, performing heavy manual labor related to environmental conservation and restoration projects.  Most projects require hiking out to project sites for the day with tools, equipment, and a day pack. Projects can include the following, but are not limited to: 

Brush and log out trail corridors.  
Mitigate drainage issues through water diversion methods, stepping stones, and natural surface improvements.  
Repair creek crossings and eroded segments to enhance trail navigability and reduce sedimentation.  
Decommission and obscure unauthorized user-created trails.  
Timber step installation  
Trail tread repair and widening  
Stone stair improvements or installation  
Community Service
 

Crew Life:    
SECC crews consist of 4-6 crew members and 2 crew leaders who provide project expertise, mentorship, training, and support to ensure the success of all participants. Food is provided while in the field, and crew members collaborate to plan meals and share chores, such as cooking and washing dishes. Most dietary restrictions can be accommodated if communicated in advance. Crew members must be prepared to camp, travel, complete service projects, and share meals as a team. No drug or alcohol consumption is allowed during service-related activities or travel at any time.   
 Crew members will need to supply their own personal equipment such as a day pack, work pants, hiking/work boots, etc. SECC will provide tools, protective gear and transportation between SECC office and project sites. SECC has a limited supply of loaner gear available for crew members to borrow. While this gear can be helpful, we strongly recommend that members bring as much of their own gear as possible, as the loaner equipment may not fully meet personal preferences or specific needs. 
 SECC supports a culture of feedback and growth. Crew Members will set goals at the beginning of the season and review their performance through both self-evaluation and a review with their Crew Leader in the middle and at the end of their season. Evaluations will cover areas such as professionalism, responsibility and leadership, communication, engagement, productivity, safety, and equipment use. Crew Members will also be asked to evaluate their Crew Leaders’ performance, the overall program, and their experience at the end of their term.  
  Hitch Schedule:     
This position will operate on a variable “hitch” schedule, but generally it will follow 9 days on and 5 days off for camping crews. Project days follow a 10-hour shift with scheduled time for breaks. While the staff at SECC strive to provide consistency throughout the season, personal flexibility is expected and should be prepared for when entering the term as schedules, times, and project locations are subject to change per project needs.  Applicants should be prepared to camp during hitches for the duration of the season, with lodging provided on a case-by-case basis if necessary.    
   Requirements:

 Purpose — About Southeast Conservation Corps (SECC):   
Empowering youth and adults to cultivate compassion, responsibility and life skills through community service, hard work and land stewardship.    
 SECC, a program of Conservation Legacy, is a non-profit AmeriCorps program. We engage youth (age 15-17) and young adults (ages 18-30, up to 35 for veterans) in service projects on public lands throughout the Southeast. Our AmeriCorps positions provide impactful educational and service opportunities that benefit both communities and landscapes. SECC’s participants reflect the population of the Southeast region, including youth, graduates, veterans, and individuals from various ethnic and economic backgrounds. SECC is also an active member of the AmeriCorps Disaster Response Team (A-DRT), and selected crews may be deployed on disaster response projects lasting up to 30 days. *If crew members are deployed for disaster response projects, comprehensive training will be provided. No prior knowledge or skillsets are required.* 
 SECC collaborates with land management agencies such as the United States Forest Service, National Park Service, State Parks, local municipalities, and non-profits to host day and camping crews. Our projects vary but include trail construction and maintenance, restoration of natural areas, invasive species removal, fire fuels reduction, fencing, herbicide applications, and more. Most projects involve strenuous manual labor and require hiking to and from the project sites daily, carrying tools and day packs.  
    SECC camping crews serve in frontcountry and backcountry locations, often in challenging weather conditions. While hitch schedules vary by project and location, they typically follow a 5-day on, 2-day off pattern, with 10-hour shifts and scheduled breaks throughout the day. While we aim to maintain consistency, flexibility is expected as schedules, times, and project locations are subject to change based on project needs.      
    SECC is an independent, non-residential program, and crew members are responsible for securing their own housing when not in the field. On-hitch, crews manage camp chores and prepare all their own meals, with evenings often including group discussions. Members must provide their own personal outdoor gear (e.g., tent, sleeping bag, sleeping pad, day pack, multi-day pack, work pants, hiking/work boots), while SECC provides group camp equipment, tools, protective gear and transportation between SECC Office and project sites.

 Emergency Response – APHIS is an emergency response agency.  This means that all Agency employees may be asked or assigned to participate in rotating temporary duty assignments to support emergency programs at some time during their careers with APHIS.  It is difficult to predict the frequency with which such emergency situations may occur – and could range from several emergencies in a year to none over the course of many years.  In the event that you are called upon to support an emergency program, this may require irregular working hours, including overtime, and may include duties other than those specified in your official position description.  While some emergency program support assignments may be able to be performed at the employee’s current duty station, in other cases employees may be asked to go on-site to a temporary duty state location.  In addition, it may be necessary for employees to participate in multiple rotations to an emergency program assignment.  Attempts will be made to keep disruption to the employee to a minimum.

  Purpose — About Southeast Conservation Corps (SECC):
Empowering youth and adults to cultivate compassion, responsibility and life skills through community service, hard work and land stewardship.  
 SECC, a program of Conservation Legacy, is a non-profit AmeriCorps program. We engage youth (age 15-17) and young adults (ages 18-30, up to 35 for veterans) in service projects on public lands throughout the Southeast. Our AmeriCorps positions provide impactful educational and service opportunities that benefit both communities and landscapes. SECC’s participants reflect the population of the Southeast region, including youth, graduates, veterans, and individuals from various ethnic and economic backgrounds. 
SECC collaborates with land management agencies such as the United States Forest Service, National Park Service, State Parks, local municipalities, and non-profits to host day and camping crews. Our projects vary but include trail construction and maintenance, restoration of natural areas, invasive species removal, fire fuels reduction, fencing, herbicide applications, and more. Most projects involve strenuous manual labor and require hiking to and from the project sites daily, carrying tools and day packs.   
  SECC camping crews serve in frontcountry and backcountry locations, often in challenging weather conditions. While hitch schedules vary by project and location, they typically follow a 9-day on, 5-day off pattern, with 10-hour shifts and scheduled breaks throughout the day. While we aim to maintain consistency, flexibility is expected as schedules, times, and project locations are subject to change based on project needs.  
  SECC is an independent, non-residential program, and crew members are responsible for securing their own housing when not in the field. On-hitch, crews manage camp chores and prepare all their own meals, with evenings often including group discussions. Members must provide their own personal outdoor gear (e.g., tent, sleeping bag, sleeping pad, day pack, multi-day pack, work pants, hiking/work boots), while SECC provides group camp equipment, tools, protective gear and transportation between SECC Office and project sites. 
    Description of Duties — Position Summary 
 Service Project:  
Southeast Conservation Corps (SECC) and Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area (LBL) have partnered to host a Recreation and Fire Prevention Crew. The crew will be based out of SECCs Chattanooga, TN office and travel to LBL to primarily support recreation and fire management operations. 
The crew will be managed by LBL Forest Service staff and collaboratively aid in these pre-identified restoration projects. During their time in the field, crew members camp overnight and serve outdoors in all weather conditions, performing heavy manual labor related to environmental conservation and restoration projects. Most projects require hiking out to project sites for the day with tools, equipment, and a day pack.  
The projects will vary based on priorities and environmental factors but will focus on: 
Hazard tree removal and sawyer work, including felling, bucking, limbing, swamping, etc.  
Traditional trail building/maintenance, including logging out, brushing, reblazing, tread repair, water-bar installation, etc.   
Recreation site improvements including trailhead and signage maintenance/replacement.  
Restoration/stabilization of shelters and other structures 
Establishment of prescribed fire containment line, completed with traditional wildland firefighting tools, such as: leaf blower, fire rake, rogue hoe, Mcleod, Pulaski, etc. 
 *Note: the above projects are in support of fire mitigation and fuels reduction; this crew will not participate in prescribed or wildland fire. 
 Crew Life:  
SECC crews consist of 4-6 crew members and 2 crew leaders who provide project expertise, mentorship, training, and support to ensure the success of all participants.

Most dietary restrictions can be accommodated if communicated in advance. Crew members must be prepared to camp, travel, complete service projects, and share meals as a team. No drug or alcohol consumption is allowed during service-related activities or travel at any time.  
 Crew members will need to supply their own personal equipment such as a day pack, work pants, hiking/work boots, etc. SECC will provide tools, protective gear and transportation between SECC office and project sites. SECC has a limited supply of loaner gear available for crew members to borrow. While this gear can be helpful, we strongly recommend that members bring as much of their own gear as possible, as the loaner equipment may not fully meet personal preferences or specific needs. 
 SECC supports a culture of feedback and growth. Crew Members will set goals at the beginning of the season and review their performance through both self-evaluation and a review with their Crew Leader in the middle and at the end of their season. Evaluations will cover areas such as professionalism, responsibility and leadership, communication, engagement, productivity, safety, and equipment use. Crew Members will also be asked to evaluate their Crew Leaders’ performance, the overall program, and their experience at the end of their term.  
   Hitch Schedule:  
This position will operate on a variable “hitch” schedule, but generally it will follow 9 days on and 5 days off for camping crews. Project days follow a 10-hour shift with scheduled time for breaks. While the staff at SECC strive to provide consistency throughout the season, personal flexibility is expected and should be prepared for when entering the term as schedules, times, and project locations are subject to change per project needs. Applicants should be prepared to camp during hitches for the duration of the season, with lodging provided on a case-by-case basis if necessary.

Most projects involve strenuous manual labor and require hiking to and from the project sites daily, carrying tools and day packs.   
 SECC camping crews serve in frontcountry and backcountry locations, often in challenging weather conditions. While hitch schedules vary by project and location, they typically follow a 9-day on, 5-day off pattern, with 10-hour shifts and scheduled breaks throughout the day. While we aim to maintain consistency, flexibility is expected as schedules, times, and project locations are subject to change based on project needs.      
 SECC is an independent, non-residential program, and crew members are responsible for securing their own housing when not in the field. On-hitch, crews manage camp chores and prepare all their own meals, with evenings often including group discussions. Members must provide their own personal outdoor gear (e.g., tent, sleeping bag, sleeping pad, day pack, multi-day pack, work pants, hiking/work boots), while SECC provides group camp equipment, tools, protective gear and transportation between SECC Office and project sites.     
   Description of Duties — Position Summary 

Southeast Conservation Corps (SECC) Strike Team has partnered with a range of land managers across the Southeast, including the U.S. Forest Service at Bankhead National Forest, The Nature Conservancy (TNC) in South Carolina, and Tennessee State Parks. This multi-agency initiative is rooted in a shared commitment to restoring land integrity, enhancing visitor experiences, and preparing young adults for careers in conservation. 


Crews should anticipate some hitches in rugged backcountry conditions and will be camping in remote, primitive settings to complete essential conservation projects.  

Service Project: 
Members of the Strike Team should expect a wide array of land management projects. During their time in the field, crew members camp overnight and serve outdoors in all weather conditions, performing heavy manual labor related to environmental conservation and restoration projects.  Most projects require hiking out to project sites for the day with tools, equipment, and a day pack. Projects can include the following, but are not limited to: 
Brush and log out trail corridors.  
Mitigate drainage issues through water diversion methods, stepping stones, and natural surface improvements.  
Repair creek crossings and eroded segments to enhance trail navigability and reduce sedimentation.  
Decommission and obscure unauthorized user-created trails.  
Timber step installation  
Trail tread repair and widening  
Stone stair improvements or installation  
Community Service 
 Crew Life:    
SECC crews consist of 4-6 crew members and 2 crew leaders who provide project expertise, mentorship, training, and support to ensure the success of all participants.

Most dietary restrictions can be accommodated if communicated in advance. Crew members must be prepared to camp, travel, complete service projects, and share meals as a team.

SECC has a limited supply of loaner gear available for crew members to borrow. While this gear can be helpful, we strongly recommend that members bring as much of their own gear as possible, as the loaner equipment may not fully meet personal preferences or specific needs. 
 SECC supports a culture of feedback and growth. Crew Members will set goals at the beginning of the season and review their performance through both self-evaluation and a review with their Crew Leader in the middle and at the end of their season. Evaluations will cover areas such as professionalism, responsibility and leadership, communication, engagement, productivity, safety, and equipment use. Crew Members will also be asked to evaluate their Crew Leaders’ performance, the overall program, and their experience at the end of their term.  
 Hitch Schedule:     
This position will operate on a variable “hitch” schedule, but generally it will follow 9 days on and 5 days off for camping crews. Project days follow a 10-hour shift with scheduled time for breaks.

Description
The Center for Limnology (CFL) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison is seeking a postdoctoral research associate to participate in a Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources-funded project to understand the impacts of aquatic plant management (APM) practices on native and invasive plant communities.  This project will leverage abundant state agency data sources to inform APM practices in north-temperate lakes.  The candidate will be supervised by Dr. Zach Feiner and Dr. Katie Hein, joining a vibrant research community at the CFL and interacting with a broad team of state and local collaborators.  

Successful candidates will work with WDNR partners to develop and harmonize statewide APM data with existing information on aquatic plant community surveys.  This database will then be used to investigate APM effects on plant communities, including the short- and long-term effects of APM treatment regimes on the prevalence of high-importance invasive species, as well as effects on native plant diversity, community composition, and health.  This postdoc will also have the opportunity to interface with local resource managers from across the Upper Midwest on regional APM questions, as well as develop publicly available outreach and data visualization platforms (i.e., R shiny apps, online modules).  

Requirements: Successful applicants will have a PhD (or will have graduated before they begin this project) in community or aquatic ecology, limnology, or a related field.  Candidates will be highly motivated and able to work independently and as part of a team, and have demonstrated skills in database management, quantitative analysis, proficiency in oral and written communication, and a strong track record of publication in peer-reviewed journals.  Experience in public outreach and data visualization for public audiences is preferred but not required. Two years of funding are available.  

How to apply: For questions or to apply, please submit a cover letter, CV, and contact information for three references to Dr. Zach Feiner (zsfeiner@wisc.edu).  UW-Madison is committed to providing opportunities to people from all backgrounds to help create a welcoming, empowered, and inclusive community. UW-Madison encourages women, minorities, veterans, and people with disabilities to apply.

Description
The School of Natural Resources and the Environment at West Virginia University is searching for a Master of Science (MS) student to determine occupancy and abundance of songbirds on recently (3-8 years) harvested forest stands during spring and fall migration on institutional private forests in West Virginia. Understanding how these young forest stands contribute as stopover habitat for migrating songbirds is of critical importance. This project provides a unique opportunity to evaluate use of regenerating forest stands by migrating songbirds in a large and patchily disturbed landscape. The student will determine occupancy and abundance using mist-nets and using Autonomous Recording Units (ARUs). The student will use pre-existing models to identify study areas. This research is in collaboration with National Council for Air and Stream Improvement, Inc., National Alliance of Forest Owners, and Weyerhaeuser Company under the auspices of the Wildlife Conservation Initiative, and Cornell University. 

The student will be working towards an MS in Wildlife and Fisheries Resources at West Virginia University. STARTING DATE: August 2025. The ideal applicant must be able to identify central Appalachian avian species by sight and sound and have extensive experience with mist-netting and handling birds. Applicants should also be familiar with collecting measurements of forest structure, including but not limited to: DBH, canopy cover (using spherical densiometers), Robel pole, Daubenmire frame, etc. Preference will be given to applicants with experience in R statistical packages, GIS, and song file analysis via RavenPro or similar software. Applicants should be comfortable working long days in the field during spring and fall months, ready to travel, and energetic and excited about applied avian conservation research on private working forests. Applicants will also be responsible for hiring and supervising a research technician to assist with research duties. Applicants must have completed a BS in Wildlife Biology, Ecology, or a closely related field. A minimum of 300 combined GRE score (V+Q) or 1100 on the previous scale, and a minimum 3.25 GPA are considered competitive. 

Tuition waiver is included.

To Apply: Electronic applications are preferred. To apply send a single file including: 1) a cover letter outlining any relevant mist-netting and bird handling experience, 2) resumé including an unofficial copy of transcripts and GRE scores, and 3) contact information for 3 references to Dr. Chris Lituma; cml0017@mail.wvu.edu

Description

Global Life-history, Ornithology & Behavioural Ecology (GLOBE) research group (https://GLOBEresearchgroup.com – new webpages under construction will be launched soon) focuses on ecology, behaviour, life-history strategies and population dynamics of wild animals, particularly birds, including impacts and consequences of recent environmental changes. The GLOBE research group, led by Vojtěch Kubelka from Department of Zoology and Centre for Polar Ecology at the Faculty of Sciences, University of South Bohemia in the Czech republic, has been recently awarded a prestigious ERC CZ grant: Animal migrations in a changing world – still advantageous strategy or maladaptive behaviour? for five years till 2029.


Animal migrations represent one of the greatest spectacles in nature, providing crucial ecosystem services as well as resources for human communities. Why do animals migrate? It has been thought that animals migrate to reproduce at higher latitudes, taking advantage of lower predation pressure, fewer parasites and seasonally high pulses in food supply. However, it has been highlighted that recent climate change and human pressure impacts can erode such benefits and migratory animals are declining globally with poorly understood underlying mechanisms.


We strive to tackle pressing issues: Are there still latitudinal gradients in predation, parasitism and seasonal food availability, supporting the benefits of migratory behaviour? How are migratory animals able to cope with environmental changes? What are the most important drivers and life stages limiting populations of migratory animals? To achieve this, we are executing comprehensive research of migration profitability, combining experimental, observational and comparative approaches – investigating latitudinal gradients in predation, parasites, food supply and whole life-cycles of tracked shorebirds, a suitable model taxon with intra-specific variability in migratory strategies and exposed ground nests – at 16 study sites from the Arctic to Patagonia.

Description
Earthjustice seeks an Associate Attorney to conduct legal advocacy, including litigation and administrative advocacy, with the California Regional Office. The hybrid work position requires 0-3 years post-law school legal experience. The attorney selected for this position will play a key role in legal actions that can make a real difference to people’s health and well-being and protect important environmental values. This attorney’s emphasis area will be our Right to Zero priorities. The Right to Zero program is working to transform the way we use energy and transport goods, services and ourselves across the country. From our power grid to ports, buses to garbage trucks, the Right to Zero team works to ditch fossil fuels and lead the shift to zero-emissions. The attorney will primarily focus on California-specific Right to Zero litigation and advocacy, and may also work on Right to Zero issues that are either federal or outside California, or on other California Regional Office priorities. 
 
Earthjustice is the premier nonprofit environmental law organization. We take on the biggest, most precedent-setting cases across the country. We wield the power of law and the strength of partnership to protect people’s health; to preserve magnificent places and wildlife; to advance clean energy; and to combat climate change. We partner with thousands of groups to engage on the critical environmental issues of our time and bring about positive change. We are here because the earth needs a good lawyer. 
 
 
Founded in 1971, Earthjustice has a distinguished track record of achieving significant, lasting environmental protections. We achieve this by hiring people who share a passion for justice and a healthy environment.

Earthjustice’s California Regional Office was the first of the now fifteen Earthjustice offices. With offices in San Francisco and Los Angeles, the California Regional Office covers almost all areas of our work. We fight for the rights of all Californians to a healthy environment. Earthjustice’s work in California is particularly important given California is both a health and climate leader and yet has some of the worst air in the country, is still one of the largest producers of oil in the country, faces some of the most challenging water issues, and is seeing its unique biodiversity face unprecedented threats.

Description
 *Applications will be reviewed on a rolling-basis.

USDA Forest Service Office/Lab and Location: A fellowship opportunity is available with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service (FS) within the Forest Service Southern Research Station (SRS) located in Durham, North Carolina. The opportunity may be remote.

At the heart of the USDA Forest Service's mission is their purpose. Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency’s mission and motivates their work across the agency. It’s been there from the agency’s very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the USDA Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.

The mission of the United States Forest Service (USFS) Southern Research Station (SRS) is to create science and technology needed to sustain and enhance forest ecosystems and the benefits they provide. The Center for Economics and Social Science (CESS), located within USFS-SRS, includes the Forest Economics and Policy Unit (RWU-4804). The research mission of the unit is to advance the science between natural and human-caused disturbances and economic values, and how those disturbances can be managed to reduce undesired impacts on society and ecosystems.

Research Project: The Forest Economic and Policy Unit is seeking an ORISE participant to help quantify the economic effectiveness of wildfire prevention programs (and their associated “activities”) at reducing human-caused wildfires on Tribal lands in the United States. The purpose of this experience will be to quantify temporal and spatial effects of fire prevention programs on human ignitions by including individual management practices from a time series dataset. We expect that the participant will use econometric methods to approach this research objective.

Learning Objectives: The ORISE participant will learn about relevant fire prevention programs, fire prevention activities, and associated datasets. In addition, the participant will receive guidance with novel econometric techniques, and receive support with scientific writing.

The participant will have the opportunity to collaborate and receive mentorship from scientists and mangers in USFS and Bureau of Indian Affairs. The participant will develop scientific writing and econometric skills, as well as increase proficiency using statistical software (such as STATA or R). The mentor will encourage dissemination of results among managers and research groups.  

Mentor: The mentor for this opportunity is Sonia Bruck (sonia.bruck@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor.

Anticipated Appointment Start Date: August 2025.  Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.

Appointment Length: The appointment will initially be until December 30, 2025, but may be extended upon recommendation of USDA Forest Service and is contingent on the availability of funds.

Level of Participation: The appointment is part time.

Participant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend range is $3,000-$3,500 per month.

Citizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents (LPR), and foreign nationals. Non-U.S. citizen applicants should refer to the Guidelines for Non-U.S. Citizens Details page of the program website for information about the valid immigration statuses that are acceptable for program participation. Foreign national candidates may have a mandatory in-person requirement depending on visa status.

ORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and USDA Forest Service. Participants do not become employees of USDA, USDA Forest Service, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits.

 BEAR CONSERVATION SPECIALIST


 Teton Country


The Wildlife Restoration Foundation (WRF) Bear Conservation Specialist-Teton Country position is open to qualified individuals passionate about bears and based near Victor, Driggs, Tetonia, and other towns along the Caribou-Targhee National Forest. The position is unpaid, but stipends are available to cover expenses and to reward accomplishments. The Bear Conservation Specialist (Teton Country) will rapidly gain valuable professional experience by playing an integral role on the WRF team. Work to build WRF’s bear conservation capacity and impact on Teton National Park bears as you contribute and strengthen your conservation knowledge and skills. Gain recognition for your efforts among area partners, on the WRF website, and elsewhere, as you participate in meeting WRF’s mission, which is to increase park wildlife population viability both ex situ and in situ, working closely with National Parks and Forests, zoo partners, and park gateway communities.


WRF operates effectively and efficiently and generates resources that enable measurable, boots-on-the-ground conservation results. The WRF Bear Conservation Specialist (Teton Country) will focus on implementation of the “I Am Bear Safe” Project in small towns neighboring Teton National Park’s gateway communities in Montana. The Bear Conservation Specialist (Teton Country) will collaborate with the WRF President, Director of Communications, and other team members in connection to the “I Am Bear Safe” Project.


 [https://www.wildlifeandparks.org/projects].


“I Am Bear Safe”™ (IABS) is a multi-partner Wildlife Coexistence Strategy designed to equip National Park gateway community chambers of commerce and their member businesses (“Park Gateway Partners”) to “train people not to train bears” to get in the trouble they are in now because of human behavior—a situation that is assuring bear demise. Bears are a top attraction at many National Parks and are well-managed within the parks to avoid human interaction. But communities at the park’s edge are not sufficiently prepared or equipped for the increasing pressure of more visitors coupled with rapid development, naïve new residents, and a growing number of recreationists in bear country. Park Gateway Partner (PGP) businesses are the perfect intervention point and receive marketing benefits from participating in the IABS town-based bear stewardship effort. WRF provides customized tools (signage and SWAG) that equip PGPs to effectively intercept park visitors and recreationists and equip them to be bear stewards who act responsibly by securing attractants and following park rules for recreating in bear habitat. The IABS goal is that bears perform their natural behaviors and survive without risk and distraction caused by humans.


Responsibilities:

Track the inventory of IABS materials distributed to PGPs in each town.
Distribute IABS Toolkit materials to PGPs and redistribution points.
Recruit new PGPs, as appropriate and assigned.
Field questions and relay PGP concerns to WRF.
Attend meetings of the chamber of commerce or local partner organization on occasion.
Mail out reward IABS reward magnets to Bear Quiz-takers.
Come up with novel ideas to make the IABS Project more effective.

Education & Experience

Bachelor’s degree in a relevant subject is required; graduate degree helpful.
Knowledge and experience specific to grizzly and black bears required.
Experience working with community-based organizations and/or local businesses.

WRF Bear Conservation Specialists are asked to participate in an initial training then designate 16 hours a week to WRF and agree to work with WRF for 4 months. The Bear Conservation Specialist (Teton Country) Should be a self-starter, ambitious, creative, productive, and dedicated to WRF’s mission. S/he must also exhibit a high degree of professionalism, accountability, and ability to follow instructions and manage time well. S/he should be friendly and approachable, well-spoken, bold, and personable.  The internship is unpaid, but stipends are provided for approved expenses and as results are achieved. 


The Bear Conservation Specialist (Teton Country) will report to Julie Anton Randall, WRF President. Hours are flexible within the week, with the exception that PGP deliveries and communications best occur during business hours. Participation in biweekly IABS team meetings and occasional full WRF team meetings by Zoom are required.

Please send a short (less than one page) cover letter and resume with references to wildliferestorationvolunteer@gmail.com.  Please name the electronic file as follows: [Date]_BCS-Teton-Country_[Your Name].

Thank you for your dedication to bears and excitement about being part of the Wildlife Restoration Foundation team in Teton Country!

Located along the pristine harbor in the heart of historic Charleston, the South Carolina Aquarium has been inspiring visitors for over twenty years. From our over 5,000 animals to our award-winning education team, from the Sea Turtle Care Center™ to our conservation programs protecting local species, visitors are struck with awe and inspiration as they journey through all our exhibits, representing the mountains to the sea of South Carolina.

About the South Carolina Aquarium
We are a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization and an accredited member of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums with a mission to inspire conservation of the natural world by exhibiting and caring for animals, by excelling in education and research and by providing an exceptional visitor experience.

Selected applicants will be notified by September 30, 2025

Description
Sea Turtle Care Center Interns have the opportunity to learn about and participate in the rescue, rehabilitation, and release of native sea turtle species. Interns will assist staff in all aspects of the daily care of sick and injured sea turtles, occasional medical procedures, and educational programs. The overall goal of our internship program is to help interns learn the ins and outs of sea turtle rehabilitation to help prepare for a career in the field.

Winter Season Specifications
The Sea Turtle Care Center is the only sea turtle hospital in the state of South Carolina. Winter is our slower season in regard to local strandings. If tank space allows, we assist northern sea turtle rehabilitation facilities by taking several cold stun patients.  This allows for the opportunity to learn how to admit a higher number of turtles at one time and to learn valuable hands-on knowledge of a common cause of stranding every winter throughout the country. While local releases are not possible during this time of year due to colder waters, it is possible that you will get the chance to participate in a release in Florida.

Commitment & Qualifications
Length of internship: 5 months
Hours per week: 32-40 hours on average. Will require flexible hours such as long days, weekend shifts, occasional late night/early morning work, and holiday coverage.
Education level: Recent college graduate or college senior with a background in biology, zoology, animal science, or related field. 

Necessary Additional Skills
Demonstrates interest in environmental conservation, rehabilitation or wildlife biology
Willingness to interact professionally with the public and other staff
Ability to work with a team and independently 
Must be able to demonstrate initiative and be detail oriented

Compensation & Benefits
At this time, the South Carolina Aquarium does not provide compensation or housing. We know how difficult it is to commit to an unpaid internship, but we try our best to incorporate as many learning opportunities as possible and to work with you. Our desired schedule is working four days with three consecutive days off. 

We offer professional development workshops in order to help you become a more competitive job candidate.

Description
Law Clerk Program

Summer 2026 Law Clerkships will accept applications from July through Labor Day 2025.


About Us


Founded in 1971, Earthjustice has a distinguished track record of achieving significant, lasting environmental protections. We achieve this by hiring people who share a passion for justice and a healthy environment. We wield the power of law and the strength of partnership to protect people’s health; preserve magnificent places and wildlife; advance clean energy; and combat climate change. We partner with thousands of groups and supporters to take on the biggest, most precedent-setting cases across the country and have a distinguished track record of achieving significant, lasting environmental protections. We are here because the earth needs a good lawyer.


Earthjustice’s work is currently divided into three major areas:

Lands, Wildlife, and Oceans focuses on cases that protect endangered species, national forests, national parks, other public lands, water resources, and the oceans.
Healthy Communities focuses on cases that protect public health, prevent air and water pollution, and curb exposures to toxic chemicals, particularly in disproportionately impacted communities. Recently, our healthy communities work has also begun to promote sustainable food and agriculture and the rights of farm workers.
Climate and Energy focuses on cases that encourage the swift and just transition to clean energy while challenging the reliance on coal, oil, and other dirty fuels.

We welcome all interested law students from across the country to apply for a summer law clerk position. We expect that students will work proximate to or in an office where the program is located. In some limited instances, an office may hire clerks to work in an area that is outside that team’s geographic area, but still proximate to an Earthjustice office.


Please note the location preferences of each litigation team in their descriptions below.


Responsibilities


Summer law clerks will have the opportunity to work with several attorneys on case development and litigation strategy. Students may draft pleadings and briefs, do legal research, develop strategy and legal theories, gather evidence, and attend client meetings and court proceedings. Earthjustice’s summer law clerk program also includes various programmatic offerings, such as in-person and virtual seminars with attorneys and guest speakers on current environmental issues, interactions with other local and regional environmental groups, and a job interview workshop.


Compensation


Earthjustice summer law clerkships are paid positions. The total stipend amount will be dependent on any external funding a student secures, such as through their law school’s summer funding program. Earthjustice will provide a one-time stipend at the start of the clerkship in the amount of $1,320.00 per week, minus the total amount received from any other sources and applicable taxes. The summer law clerkship is designed to be 10 weeks long at full-time hours (37.5 hours/week).


You are welcome to pursue outside funding. The ability to secure outside funding will not be considered as part of the hiring process.


How to Apply


Eligibility: Candidates must be enrolled in a U.S. law school through fall 2026 (i.e., not graduating before December 2026) and be available to commit to 10 weeks during summer 2026. Summer law clerks must work from the U.S. during their clerkship.


Each Earthjustice litigation team participates in clerk hiring; candidates may submit applications to whichever and however many litigation teams they are interested. Please be prepared to respond to our September follow-up e-mail, requesting your ranked choice of the teams for which you have applied. Do not include such rankings within your Jobvite application.

     Position Summary:   
The crew leader will supervise two crew members and an assistant crew leader for a Department of Interior (DOI) Seeds of Success (SOS) team, operated by Southwest Conservation Corps (SCC). The crew will be based out of the SCC Durango office. The crew will collect seeds from native species in remote areas on DOI land following SOS protocols.  Crews will be required to drive to different areas throughout Colorado, camp overnight, potentially hike several miles a day, and return to the office for equipment and data management. This position requires significant driving relative to other types of field work. Crew leaders must be prepared for long days of driving and scouting from a truck. This position also requires the ability to maintain focus during highly repetitive and meticulous work. Safety is a pre-requisite, particularly where industry development (energy extraction, e.g. natural gas) is occurring and during hunting season. Risk management will guide how fieldwork is conducted. The crew leader will be responsible for adhering to check-out/check-in procedures and communications via inReach device to ensure crew safety.     

Seed collected by DOI is saved in short- and long- term storage to support development of plant materials for land restoration purposes by DOI and other entities. The crew leader will oversee and be accountable for successful data management, including record filing, database input, and seed processing in order to preserve plant species for future generations. 
 Specific duties will include selecting and locating populations of plant species based on the established SOS Protocol, and locally developed target species lists. The crew leader will oversee fieldwork and work with crew members to locate populations of targeted species, monitor phenology of the population, collect botanical voucher specimens, assess seed quantity and quality prior to seed collection, collect seed, record site data, prepare documentation, and ship collected seed for cleaning and short-term storage. The ability to identify plants both in the field and in the office via dichotomous keys is an important function of the position. However, help with plant ID will be provided, and IDs will be reviewed. The crew leader will use ArcGIS tablet applications (i.e. ArcCollector) software to locate and document collections. Use of 4-wheel drive vehicles in rugged off-road situations is expected. Familiarity with this equipment is highly desirable, but training will be provided where needed.   

 While Seeds of Success is the primary focus, the crew may also assist with other conservation program projects during the season to promote additional education and experience. 
 This position requires patience, a consistently positive mental attitude, mentorship, technical aptitude, focus on efficiency, and a high level of competence in the outdoors. It also involves an administration role, where weekly paperwork is due in a timely manner to supervisors. Finally, crew leaders must exhibit the ability to effectively work on diverse teams and those from a variety of populations and communities. 
 Housing: Crews are responsible for their own housing, transportation, and food between camping trips. For the most part, housing is not provided. We are glad to talk through your options with you in the interview and onward.  
 Training: The term begins with leadership training which focuses on developing outdoor leadership skills, goal setting, technical and field skills training and developing an understanding of SCC policies. Following leadership training, crew leaders will attend a SOS protocol training with the Bureau of Land Management. Informal hands-on training will continue throughout the term with on-the-ground skills training. The crew leader will help train the crew members and contribute to a regional seed collection training. Depending on the project needs, crews may receive specialized training.  

Schedule: Season will start with two weeks of training, 5 days on, 2 days off. Once in the field, hitch schedule will vary based on need with switching from 4 days on, 3 days off to 8 days on, 6 days off. Applicants should expect the project schedule to vary and to have nontraditional work hours including weekends and evening hours. Workdays will start with stretch and safety where crews warm up and review any safety risks for the day.  Days include two 15-minute breaks and one 30-minute lunch. On-hitch, crews camp together, prepare all meals together, and work together as a group to complete all projects and chores.  

Gear: Participants must supply their own personal outdoor gear and equipment such as a tent, sleeping bag, sleeping pad, day pack, work pants, hiking/work boots, etc. A suggested gear-list will be provided prior to starting the term of service. Additionally, SCC has pro-deals and some gear available to borrow.  

 Responsibilities:   
Leadership & Mentorship  
Implement skills training on worksite and facilitate intentional discussions via informal lessons to contribute to the crew’s personal growth and group dynamics.   
Promote individual corps member development and a safe, healthy, cohesive, other-centered and team-oriented community.   
  Work in tandem with the assistant crew lead to communicate directions, project specifications, and provide constructive feedback.

 Terms of Service: 
Start Date: Must start by July 28th. (July 14th ideal start).
End Date: Term will last 15 weeks from start date.
AmeriCorps Slot Classification: 450 hours 
 Purpose: 
This AmeriCorps Program partners with the National Parks Service (NPS). This program fosters invaluable mentorship to early-career individuals and provides a unique opportunity to develop relationships within and become familiar with the workings of non-profit and government agencies. The purpose of this position is to collect native seeds for research, development, germplasm conservation, and ecosystem restoration. The long-term conservation outcome of this program is to support the development of native plant materials for restoring and supporting ecosystems.

Description of Duties: 
The Assistant Crew Leader (ACL) works with a Crew Leader (CL) to supervise two crew members for a Department of Interior (DOI) Seeds of Success (SOS) team, operated by Southwest Conservation Corps (SCC). The crew will be based out of the SCC Durango office. The crew will collect seeds from native species in remote areas across Southern Colorado and Northern New Mexico following SOS protocols. The ACL and CL will be trained in planning techniques for a successful field season. Subsequently, the ACL and CL will help train the crew members and contribute to regional seed collection training. Crews will be required to drive to different areas throughout Colorado, camp overnight, potentially hike several miles a day, and return to the office for equipment and data management. This position requires significant driving relative to other types of field work. ACLs and CLs must be prepared for long days of driving and scouting from a truck. This position also requires the ability to maintain focus during highly repetitive and meticulous work. Safety is a pre-requisite, particularly where industry development (energy extraction, e.g. natural gas) is occurring during hunting season. Risk management will guide how fieldwork is conducted.   

Specific duties will include selecting and locating populations of plant species based on the established SOS Protocol, and locally developed target species lists. The ACL and CL will oversee fieldwork and work with crew members to locate populations of targeted species, monitor phenology of the population, collect botanical voucher specimens, assess seed quantity and quality prior to seed collection, collect seed, record site data, prepare documentation, and ship collected seed for cleaning and short-term storage. The ability to identify plants both in the field and in the office via dichotomous keys is an important function of the position. However, help with plant ID will be provided, and IDs will be reviewed. Use of 4-wheel drive vehicles in rugged off-road situations is expected. Familiarity with this equipment is highly desirable, but training will be provided where needed.   

While Seeds of Success is the primary focus, the crew may also assist with other conservation program projects during the season to promote additional education and experience.   

Assistant Crew Leaders (ACL) are responsible for facilitating a safe and positive crew member experience by setting an example of enthusiasm, dedication, and a strong work ethic throughout work and camp life. The ACL works in tandem with the Crew Leader to communicate directions, project specifications, and provide constructive criticism throughout the term of service. The ACL will expand their role, learn leadership strategies, and assume full leadership duties if the Crew Leader is unavailable. We seek individuals who consistently demonstrate discretion and judgment, embracing the responsibility of identifying, communicating, and proactively addressing safety, logistical, or interpersonal issues. We expect a proactive approach and involvement at every step. 

Housing: Crews are responsible for their own housing, transportation, and food between camping trips. For the most part, housing is not provided. We are glad to talk through your options with you in the interview and onward.  
 Gear: Participants must supply their own personal outdoor gear and equipment such as a tent, sleeping bag, sleeping pad, day pack, work pants, hiking/work boots, etc. A suggested gear-list will be provided prior to starting the term of service. Additionally, SCC has pro-deals and some gear available to borrow.

Spend several hours per day safely operating 4WD trucks on paved and unpaved roads, often in remote areas on unimproved roads.  
Excellent judgment in assessing physical, mental, and emotional risk while effectively working in and around adverse conditions, including extreme heat, sun exposure, monsoonal rains, and hazardous wildlife (i.e., rattlesnakes, scorpions, biting/stinging insects, cattle, and horses).
